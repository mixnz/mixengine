# **Every signature carries a trusted comment, and one of them is read back by a program** — roadmap
# task T88a.
#
# minisign's *global* signature covers this text, which makes it the one place a fact about a signed
# file can travel without being taken on trust. `mixengine-elevate` needs exactly that: the elevated
# process installing a replacement has verified the bytes and still has no other way to learn which
# version, and which machine, they are for. `mixengine_proto::privileged::HelperStamp` is what reads
# it back, and it refuses anything that is not this grammar.
#
# One rule and not a special case: every artifact gets `<name> <version> <os> <arch>` where `<name>`
# is what the file is called. For the helper that name *is* `mixengine-elevate`, which is what makes
# the stamp parse; for everything else the fields are there for a person reading `minisign -V`.
#
# **The helper's stamp carries the helper's own version** (T182b, D1), which is what its asset is
# named by and what the installed helper compares a replacement against — not the release's.
