# Windows: what an unsigned release looks like to SmartScreen.
#
# Roadmap task T86a, design:
# docs/specs/2026-09-04-t86a-unsigned-distribution-design.md
#
# **This measures the mark, not the verdict.** SmartScreen's Application Reputation gate is reached
# through `ShellExecute` on a file carrying Mark-of-the-Web — the `Zone.Identifier` stream a browser
# writes. No mark, no gate, whatever the file's reputation. So the question "how often does a user
# see the warning" reduces to "which files in a MixEngine install ever carry a mark", and that is a
# property of our own artifacts rather than of a cloud service. The verdict itself needs a browser, a
# reputation lookup and a person — release checklist item 4 in
# docs/operations/build-and-release.md.
#
# Two rules this script is built on, both from the design:
#
#   * **Fail on our artifacts, record on the environment** (D3). An installer that starts
#     propagating a mark fails the job. A machine that cannot answer a question produces a *void
#     reading*, printed under its own heading — because a green job that measured nothing must not
#     look like a green job that measured and found nothing.
#   * **Never disarm the machine to get a reading** (D9). Nothing here touches a SmartScreen policy,
#     a Defender exclusion or Code Integrity. A reading taken on a machine we disarmed is about our
#     tampering and not about the product.
