# Write `latest.json` — what an installed MixEngine reads to find out that a newer one exists.

# Roadmap task T88, the design's D13.
# Design: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-t88-self-update-design.md
#
# **Run in the `release` job, before `sign.sh`, and nowhere else.** The feed lists the payload
# archives of *every* leg, and no build leg can see the other four; and it is signed by being in the
# distribution directory when the signing step runs, which is what puts `latest.json.minisig` beside
# it under the name `mixengine_core::index::Client` appends.
#
# **The notes come from `git` and not from GitHub.** The release job's order is: gather the legs,
# sign, create the draft with `--generate-notes`, upload. So the notes GitHub generates do not exist
# until after the signing is over, and a document signed before them cannot contain them. Re-signing
# afterwards would put the private key on the machine of whoever edits the draft, which is the one
# thing T86 arranged not to need. What this writes instead is the tag's own commit subjects, and a
# `notes_url` pointing at the page somebody may have edited afterwards.
