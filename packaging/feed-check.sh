# **What this looks at is the shape of the `provides` keys.** `index::format::Artifact` documents
# them as executable *name* to path (`{"php": "php.exe"}`), `updates::apply::binary_name` appends
# this platform's suffix itself, and `updates::apply::stage` looks the smoke-test executable up as
# `mixengined`. A Windows payload described with the `.exe` on the key satisfies none of those, and
# the only sign of it is a `mix self-update` that refuses the release it was just offered.
#
# No packaging tools, and nothing OS-specific: the fixture archives are written by `tar` and by
# `python3`'s own `zipfile`, and `feed.sh` already requires `python3`. So this runs on the machine of
# whoever is editing the script, whichever of the three that is.
