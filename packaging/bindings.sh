# The MixEngine API contract

TypeScript types for every request, response, event and error `mixengined` speaks over its local
JSON-RPC transport. Generated from the `mixengine-proto` crate with
[ts-rs](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/ts-rs); **do not edit** — every file here is rewritten from
the Rust types by `packaging/bindings.sh`, and CI fails when the two disagree.

MixEngine's desktop application is typed against this directory directly, and it is published as
an archive on every release for any other client.

## What it says, and what it does not

These types describe **what the daemon writes**, and the strict form of what it reads. A few
requests are deliberately more forgiving than that — a duration may arrive as `"10s"` as well as
`10000`, an environment value as a bare string as well as its tagged form — and the contract does
not describe those alternatives. Send the shape below and it is always accepted.

Integers are `number`, never `bigint`: these values arrive through `JSON.parse`, which produces one
and not the other.

## Using it

There is no runtime code here at all, so nothing to build and nothing to import at run time:

```ts
import type { DaemonStatus, DaemonEvent, Error as MixEngineError } from "@mixengine/api";
```

The wire failure type is called `Error`, after the Rust type it is generated from. Rename it on
import, as above — a bare `Error` shadows the global one for the rest of the file.

The protocol version is not in this package on purpose. A client learns it from the handshake, which
is the only end of the connection that knows it.
