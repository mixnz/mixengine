# The same version, spelled the way a native Linux package manager can order it.
#
# **`.deb` and `.rpm` both read `-` as structure rather than as text**, so a pre-release cannot be
# handed to either as it is written. rpm refuses it outright — `Illegal char '-' (0x2d) in: Version:
# 0.0.1-beta.1`, measured on the first tag that had one — because the hyphen is what separates
# version from release. dpkg is worse than that: it accepts the same string, reads the last hyphen as
# the revision separator, and then orders `0.0.1-beta.1` *above* the `0.0.1` it comes before, so the
# beta would be offered as an upgrade over the final release.
#
# Both formats spell a pre-release with `~`, which sorts before everything including the empty
# string — `0.0.1~beta.1 < 0.0.1` on either system, which is the semver ordering. Build metadata goes
# the same way: `+` is a character `set-version.mjs` allows and neither format has a meaning for.
#
# Only the two native packages use this. Every other artifact is named for the version as written,
# because `packaging/feed.sh` matches payloads by name and `mixengine_core::index` parses semver.
