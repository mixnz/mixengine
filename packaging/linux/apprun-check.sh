#
# **The case worth having a fixture for is the second run**, where the cache already holds what an
# earlier build of the same version put there: the guard used to be `mix` alone, so a machine that
# had run one would never gain a binary a later build added — and the cache is what the AppImage
# actually executes, so a binary missing from it is missing from the product however well the image
# was packed.
#
# Runs anywhere: nothing here is an AppImage, nothing needs `appimagetool`, and nothing is
# Linux-specific. So the person editing `AppRun` can check it on the machine they are editing it on
# rather than on a runner an hour later.
