# MixEngine documentation map

**This folder is for whoever builds MixEngine. [`docs/guide/`](../docs/guide/) is for whoever uses
it** — the user handbook, sixteen pages in English and Vietnamese, published at
`https://mixnz.github.io/mixengine/` and compiled into `mix docs` (T90,
[ADR 0021](decisions/0021-the-handbook-is-one-corpus-published-three-ways.md)). The two trees never
restate each other: a fact about *why* MixEngine is shaped this way belongs here, and a fact about
*how to use it* belongs there.

This folder holds the detail that [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) deliberately keeps out. Each folder has
one job:

| Folder | Answers | Read it when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [architecture/](architecture/) | *How the system is put together* | Adding a subsystem, changing a boundary |
| [features/](features/) | *What each user-facing feature must do* | Implementing or changing a feature |
| [standards/](standards/) | *How we write code here* | Writing anything |
| [operations/](operations/) | *How it gets built, packaged, shipped* | Touching CI, installers, runtime bundles |
| [decisions/](decisions/) | *Why it is this way* | Questioning an existing choice |
| [roadmap/](roadmap/) | *What to build next, in order* | Picking up work |
| [reviews/](reviews/) | *How good what is built actually is, at a date* | Reviewing the codebase, or checking whether a past finding was fixed |

## Reading order for a newcomer

1. [architecture/overview.md](architecture/overview.md) — the whole system on one page
2. [architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md](architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md) — how clients talk to the core
3. [architecture/data-model.md](architecture/data-model.md) — the nouns and their relationships
4. [roadmap/todo.md](roadmap/todo.md) — where we are (index over the per-phase files)
