# Automatic HTTPS

**Goal**: every site is `https://` with a green padlock in every browser, with no manual `openssl`
and no expiry surprises.

## Design

An internal CA (see [architecture/security-model.md](../architecture/security-model.md) for the
security constraints) issues short-lived per-site leaf certificates. We do **not** use ACME or
Let's Encrypt — local domains are not publicly resolvable and rate limits would bite.

```
certs/
  ca/root.crt  ca/root.key         ECDSA P-256, 10 years, pathlen:0
  sites/blog.test.crt / .key       90 days, SANs = every domain of the site
```

## First run

1. Generate the CA (`rcgen`).
2. Explain, in one screen, what installing it does and what it means.
3. Install into the OS trust store — **batched into the same elevation prompt** as the resolver
   config and the port grant, so first run costs one prompt in total. On Linux additionally into NSS DBs
   (`~/.pki/nssdb`, Firefox profiles) because Chrome and Firefox there do not read the system store.
4. Record `ca.installed_in_trust_store` and the fingerprint.

**Step 4 is not how T49a answers the question.** Nothing is recorded: `cert.ca_status` reads the
store every time it is asked, and the daemon reads it at every start. A stored flag would be a claim
about a machine that an operating-system update, another account, or a person with `certmgr` can
falsify without MixEngine hearing about it — and the read costs no privilege on any of the three
systems, which is what makes asking cheaper than remembering.

If the user declines, sites still work over HTTP; `https_enabled` is refused with a hint.

## Issuance

`cert.issue { site }` — **built in T50**:

- Leaf key ECDSA P-256, `serverAuth` EKU only, `digitalSignature` only, `IsCa::ExplicitNoCa`,
  90 days, `CN` = the primary domain, SANs = **exactly** the site's domains in the site's own order.
- The private key is written first, with the mode `mixengine_platform::write_private` gives it, then
  the certificate: a crash between the two leaves a state `leaf::read` can name.
- Issuance is idempotent, and it asks **four** questions before reusing what is there — see below.
- The front end serves it from **T51**, which is below.

## Serving it

**A site with a certificate has two addresses**, `http://` and `https://`, both serving the same
site. No redirect: a local webhook or an old client pointed at plaintext keeps working, and a POST
that follows a redirect only sometimes is a bug nobody attributes to their web server.

**A site whose certificate is missing is served over HTTP alone** rather than failing to render.
Validation judges a whole rendering, so one site with a `tls` line pointing at nothing would cost
every other site its configuration. `mix doctor`'s `SiteCertificateMissing` is where the gap is
reported, and it repairs without a prompt.

**Caddy renders two site blocks and nginx renders one `server`**, and the asymmetry is a fact about
the two programs rather than an inconsistency: Caddy attaches `tls` to a site block, so a block
naming both schemes is refused — `server listening on [:80] is HTTP, but attempts to configure TLS
connection policies` — while nginx attaches `ssl` to a `listen` line, so one block carries both.
Both were measured against the real program rather than reasoned about.

**Reload happens because the rendered file changed**, and it changes because its header carries the
certificate's fingerprint. A certificate is reissued to the same path, so nothing else about the
file would differ, the installer would find no change, and the running server would go on serving
the certificate it already holds in memory.

**From T51 a front end actually binds the TLS port.** It never did before, because no site had a
certificate. Both servers refuse the *whole* configuration when one listener cannot be bound, so on
a machine that has not been granted the ports the failure is not "no HTTPS" but "the reload was
refused and the old configuration is still running". The first-run grant covers 80 and 443 together,
so a machine that can bind one can bind the other — and `https_port` is a setting on both recipes so
that a test, or a person, can move it.

**T50 corrected three things this section said.** `cert.issue { domains }` would let a client decide
what a certificate covers, which is business logic in a client; the method names a **site**, and the
daemon reads that site's domains from its own rows. "SANs = the site's domains + `localhost` aliases
where relevant" is not implementable — nothing defines *relevant* — and a SAN added on MixEngine's
initiative would be in every certificate it ever issued, so the SAN list is exactly the site's
domains. And `*.blog.test` is **not** allowed: `domains::normalised` has refused wildcards since T44,
whose DNS server is what answers them, so no site row can hold one.

**Reuse asks a fourth question this section does not have**: was the certificate signed by the
authority this home has *now*. Without it, T54's rotation leaves every site holding a leaf that
parses, covers the right names and has eighty days left — and that no browser accepts. The
comparison is the leaf's issuer name against the authority's subject name, which is free because T48
put the key's identity into that name.

**And issuance runs before configuration is generated, never as part of it.** `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
says generated configuration is disposable and rebuilt from SQLite; a certificate is state that
cannot be rebuilt from a row, and throwing one away costs the trust of every browser holding a cached
chain. The daemon's start orders it — authority, trust stores, browsers, **certificates**, then the
generators — and `site.create` and `site.update` issue before their own walk.

## Renewal

- A scheduler task renews anything with **< 30 days** left, on the period `[certs]
  renew_check_seconds` sets — hourly by default — plus a check on daemon start. The second is what
  covers a machine switched off more than it is on, and it has been there since T50.
- **Hourly rather than daily, and the threshold is the reason.** A 24-hour timer on a laptop is not
  24 hours: Tokio measures from `std::time::Instant`, which counts no time on Linux or macOS while
  the machine is suspended, so an alarm set for tomorrow can ring on Tuesday. Rather than make the
  alarm accurate, the check is made cheap enough that its accuracy stops mattering — a certificate
  is replaced a month before it expires, and that month is the tolerance a late tick spends. It also
  means a late tick has nothing to catch up on: a pass that finds nothing due does nothing.
- Renewal reissues, hands the result to the generator, and emits `CertExpiring` **only if renewal
  failed** — once per outage rather than once per attempt, because a disk that is full at nine is
  full at ten and the event stream holds 1024 messages for every client together.
- **The reload is not a mechanism of its own.** A renewed certificate has a new fingerprint, the
  fingerprint is in each rendered site file's header (T51), so the file differs, `document::install`
  finds a change and the front end re-reads. Renewal calls the generator and nothing else.
- **A home with no usable authority renews nothing and announces nothing**, exactly as `mix
  doctor`'s site-certificate check is `Skipped` there. One damaged authority is one problem, and
  announcing it once per site would bury the line that says what to fix.
- Browsers reject certs longer than 398 days; even though these are private, staying at 90 days keeps
  us compatible with any future tightening.

## Services

**A managed database gets a leaf from the same authority** — roadmap task **T99**, designed in
[docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-t99-a-certificate-for-the-database-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-t99-a-certificate-for-the-database-design.md).
From 11.4 MariaDB turns TLS on by default and, given no certificate, generates a 4096-bit RSA key
at every start — seconds on a laptop, the whole spread of the M3 bench — while an 11.4 client with
a password on its command line refuses a server that has turned TLS off. So
`certs/services/<service-id>.{key,crt}` holds a leaf covering `localhost` and the instance's IPv4
bind address, ninety days like a site's, reissued at a start with under thirty left and on the same
four questions (including the authority's identity, so a rotation reaches it). The generator issues it
just before the render; a home with no usable authority renders no `ssl_*` line and the server
does what it did before. Nothing reloads a running server's certificate — `mix service restart`
is the renewal — and `mix cert status` lists sites only.

## Trust store details

| OS | Store | Command / API | Removal |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Windows | `LocalMachine\Root` | CryptoAPI (`CertAddEncodedCertificateToStore`) | `CertDeleteCertificateFromStore` |
| macOS | System keychain | `security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain` | `security delete-certificate -Z <the SHA-1 `security` reported>` — **not** `remove-trusted-cert`, which never returns |
| Linux | `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/mixengine.crt` + `update-ca-certificates` (Debian) / `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` + `update-ca-trust` (RHEL) | elevated file write | remove file + update |
| Firefox/Chrome on Linux | every NSS DB found under `~/.pki/nssdb`, `~/.mozilla/firefox/*/`, `~/snap/firefox/common/.mozilla/firefox/*/`, `~/snap/chromium/common/chromium/`, `~/.var/app/org.mozilla.firefox/.mozilla/firefox/*/` and `~/.var/app/com.google.Chrome/.pki/nssdb` — a directory counts when it holds `cert9.db` | `certutil -A -d sql:<dir> -n "MixEngine Local CA <key_id>" -t C,, -i <file>` | `certutil -D -d sql:<dir> -n "MixEngine Local CA <key_id>"` |

Detect the distro family by probing for the directories, not by parsing `/etc/os-release` version
strings.

**The `certutil` fallback on Windows was not built** — T49a, D6. This row used to name one; the API
is four calls, and spawning a process from a context holding an administrative token is a larger
surface than that, not a smaller one.

**A removal names an authority, never a certificate** — T49a, D5, and this row used to say "delete by
fingerprint". It cannot: a removal that could name an arbitrary certificate could take the root that
validates Windows Update out of a machine, through the audited helper and under the user's own Allow
click. What travels is the eight-character key-id from the CA's subject, and the helper removes only
certificates that carry it **and** pass the whole shape check an install has to pass.

**On macOS "installed" means trusted, and a probe asks `security verify-cert`.** `add-trusted-cert
-d` is two writes — the certificate into the keychain, then a trust setting into the admin domain —
and the second can be refused after the first succeeded: the admin domain's authorization rule is
*entitled or authenticate-admin*, `authenticate-admin` does not exempt root, and a helper behind the
OS elevation prompt has no window to authenticate in, so `security` reports *the authorization was
denied since no user interaction was possible* and leaves the certificate in the keychain untrusted.
Measured on a first install: `find-certificate` listed the authority, `verify-cert` said
`CSSMERR_TP_NOT_TRUSTED`, and `mix doctor` said trusted. So the probe lists the keychain for the
exact DER and then asks `verify-cert -L -p basic` whether the machine trusts it, and the install's
"already there" needs both answers.

**The helper writes the trust setting through `/bin/launchctl asuser <uid> /usr/bin/security …`**,
which puts `security` back into the caller's login session — the one that owns the screen — so the
dialog can be raised. Measured three ways on one machine: `sudo security add-trusted-cert -d` from a
terminal raised the dialog and succeeded; the same command under `do shell script … with
administrator privileges` failed with *no user interaction was possible*; the same command under the
same prompt through `launchctl asuser` raised the dialog and succeeded. The uid comes from the token
the helper verified, is digits or the command is not run, and everything else on the line is a
constant. **A first run on macOS therefore asks twice** — the OS elevation prompt, then this dialog
— and that is the operating system's price for an admin-domain trust setting; there is no cheaper
one without an Apple entitlement. Should the write still be refused, the failure carries the
terminal command that finishes it: `sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k
/Library/Keychains/System.keychain <home>/certs/ca/root.crt`.

**The macOS removal named here is not the one that was built**, and the difference was measured
rather than reasoned about. On a machine with no window server, `security remove-trusted-cert -d`
never returns — not under plain `sudo`, not under `sudo -H`, not with `HOME` unset, not against a
root-owned path, and not even when there is nothing left to remove. `trust-settings-import -d` hangs
the same way, while `trust-settings-export -d` reads that domain and `add-trusted-cert -d` writes
it: the admin trust domain there can be read and added to, and neither removed from nor replaced.

`security delete-certificate` answers at once and takes the trust setting out **with** the
certificate — the admin domain *is* `/Library/Keychains/System.keychain` rather than a store beside
it. It is targeted and not wholesale, proved by installing two certificates and deleting one: the
other was still there and still trusted. The certificate is named by the SHA-1 `security` itself
printed for it in the same listing the check ran against, so the DER remains what is checked and
nothing in the command comes from the request.

**The last row is T49b and the first three are T49a**, split at the privilege boundary: the system
stores need root and ride in the first-run elevation batch, while NSS databases belong to the user
and are written by the daemon with no prompt at all. T49b also starts from a measurement this table
does not have — on a stock Ubuntu 24.04, `certutil` is **not installed**; it ships in `libnss3-tools`.
A machine without it is a state to report, not a failure.

**T49b corrected three things this table said.** The nickname was `MixEngine`, under which two homes
on one machine overwrite each other's entry with no error; it now carries T48's key id, which is what
makes a removal precise. `~/.mozilla/firefox/*/` is where a *deb* Firefox keeps profiles — on Ubuntu
22.04 and later the `firefox` deb is a transitional package to the snap (`Version: 1:1snap1-0ubuntu5`,
`Pre-Depends: snapd`), whose profiles live under `~/snap`, so the two-root version of this row found
nothing on the distribution most people run and reported success. And the certificate goes in through
a **file**: measured, `certutil -A -i /dev/stdin` answers `SEC_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS` because it seeks
its input, and `certutil -A` with the PEM on stdin and no `-i` at all **exits 0 without installing
anything** — a silent success, which is the one outcome no caller can act on.

Nothing is created. A profile directory with no `cert9.db` has never been opened by its browser, and
a database MixEngine invented would be a file in somebody's home that no program asked for. The
legacy `cert8.db` format is not read either: Firefox has written `cert9.db` since version 58.

## Diagnostics

`mix cert status` shows, per site: what is on disk (present, days left, the names it covers) and
what the running front end **actually presents**, from a live TLS handshake. The second is the only
one a browser ever sees, and it is the only check in this system that is not a claim about a file.

- **The handshake goes to `127.0.0.1:<https_port>` with the site's name as SNI, never to a resolved
  address.** Whether a name resolves is `mix doctor`'s question — `DomainUnreachable` — and a
  handshake that resolved would report "TLS failed" on a machine whose only fault is a resolver
  nobody wired. So a green answer here plus a red padlock in a browser means the name does not reach
  this machine, and that is where to look.
- **One connection answers both questions.** The client installs a verifier that captures the chain
  *and* judges it against this home's authority, then lets the handshake complete either way — so a
  certificate a failing server presented is reported rather than replaced by an error message about
  it. Comparing issuer names instead was rejected: a chain with the right name over the wrong key
  would be called trusted by the one command a person types to ask whether it is.
- **The presented certificate is compared to the one on disk by fingerprint.** A hash differs
  whenever anything differs; comparing names would call a server holding last month's certificate
  correct as long as the names had not changed. That comparison is what catches the report this
  whole command exists for — a server still holding a certificate the file beside it has replaced,
  which every file-reading check calls healthy.
- **The answer carries a condition, not advice.** `CertProblem` is a closed set — no certificate,
  names differ, not served, served certificate differs, not trusted, expiring — in the order a
  person would act on them, first match only. `mix` turns that into the command to run; a graphical
  client turns the same condition into a button. There is no `--fix`: `mix cert issue --site` and
  `mix doctor --repair` already reissue, and a diagnostic that repaired what it found could not
  report the state it had just repaired.

## Acceptance criteria

- New site → `https://blog.test` trusted in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Edge on their respective
  platforms, with no browser restart beyond the first CA install.
- Adding a domain to an existing site reissues automatically and the padlock stays green.
- `mix cert ca-uninstall` leaves no MixEngine certificate in any store (verified by an integration
  test that enumerates the stores). **It leaves the files** — T54: `certs/ca/` and every leaf stay
  where they are, because removing trust is undone by `mix doctor --repair` and deleting a private
  key is undone by nothing. Deleting is uninstall's, T87. The enumeration runs against `mock::Host`
  and carries a control: the same enumeration *before* the call finds the authority, so a test that
  enumerated nothing cannot pass.
- `mix cert ca-rotate` completes with all sites still trusted afterwards. **Verified only under
  `MIXENGINE_SYSTEM_TESTS=1`** — a rotation writes the machine's own trust store, which rule 1 of
  `.claude/standards/testing.md` keeps out of `cargo test`, and finding that out cost a real
  certificate: an earlier draft of the T54 suite raised a UAC prompt in the middle of a test run and
  installed an authority into `LocalMachine\Root`. **CI's `system` job is where that variable is
  set**, and on two of the three systems: Windows holds a full administrator token and macOS runs the
  suite as root, so a rotation there is granted and the handshake afterwards is a real reading. A
  Linux runner has no polkit agent, so a rotation on it is refused rather than granted — this
  criterion is not measured there, and what that leg asserts instead is the invariant a refusal keeps.
  **"Afterwards" is bounded and not instant**, which the first run of that test is what established:
  `ca-rotate` returns when the front end has been *told* — the registry writes the new rendering and
  notifies, the service's own task reloads — so read the instant the command returns, both legs found
  the server still holding the leaf signed by the authority just replaced, `served_certificate_differs`
  and all. The test polls for it instead, which is what the criterion means and not a softening of it.

## Rotation and removal

**`cert.ca_rotate` changes nothing until a fresh reading of the trust store agrees** — T54. The new
authority is generated into `certs/pending/`, a staging certificates root that `ca::read` cannot see;
one elevation grant covers taking the old certificate out and putting the new one in; and only then
is the store read again. A declined prompt discards the candidate and leaves this home exactly as it
was, which is what makes a destructive operation safe to type by accident.

**The reading decides, not the prompt's own report.** `mixengine-elevate` is honest about what it
did, but it is a separate process describing finished work; a probe is a fresh reading of the thing
itself and costs no privilege on any of the three systems. The condition is not "is the new
authority installed" — that would make rotation impossible forever on a machine with no store
MixEngine can write, and such a machine is supported. It is whether this machine is *less* able to
trust the new authority than it was the old one, and the "was it trusting the old one" half has to be
read **before** the removal runs, or it always answers no and the clause never refuses anything.

**No reissue code was written.** T50 gave certificate reuse a fourth question — was this leaf signed
by the authority this home has *now* — and it was added for exactly this task. The moment
`certs/ca/root.crt` names a different authority, every leaf is stale by the existing rule, so the
call `mix cert issue` already runs replaces all of them.

**One grant, never two**, on the measurement that refused to move the trust store per-user: Windows
raises a dialog for a write *and* for a removal, and macOS asks for the account password twice. A
rotation that split its grant would spend the thing that decision bought.
