# MixEngine build plan

Phases are ordered. Work top to bottom — each phase depends on the ones above it. Tick items as they
land; when new work appears, insert it **where it belongs in the order**, not at the end.

Each phase lives in its own file; this page is the index. Task numbers (`T1`…`T93`) are global and
never reused, so a task keeps its number wherever it is cited — which is why phase 6 is a gap rather
than a renumbering, and why T56 and T64 keep their numbers in the phases they moved to.

Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · **(P)** = has a platform-layer component and
needs verification on Windows + macOS + Linux.

## Where we are

**Phase 0 is done**, and **M0 is reached**: `mix status` starts a daemon if there is none, talks to
it over the local endpoint and prints what it says, in both renderings, proved end to end by
`crates/mixengine-cli/tests/status.rs` — green on all three runners, not only the one it was written
on. The Windows third of that runs as an administrator (T2b), which changes nothing about what it
proves: `status.rs` asserts nothing a token decides. T9a closed it last, and late on purpose: a
daemon can now be *asked* to stop rather than found and killed, it stops its services in reverse
dependency order first, and the whole of that is bounded by one budget — `config.toml`'s over the
API, and whatever Windows's console clock allows when the OS is the one asking.

**Phase 1 is done.** The vocabulary, the state machine, the supervision mechanisms, the log
capture, the dependency graph, the runner, the registry, the `service.*` surface, the CLI over it and
crash recovery are in: a declared service can be started, watched, restarted and stopped through a
real socket, every move is persisted and announced from one value, and a daemon that is killed no
longer takes the truth with it — the next one adopts what survived, stops what it cannot supervise
and clears the rest, before it serves a client. Every check a `ServiceSpec` can name is now one the
supervisor can make, and a service that needs a command of its own to shut down cleanly gets one
(T15a) — which is what Phase 3 was waiting for. A service's output now reaches a person as well: on
`GET /logs/{id}` and under `mix service logs`, on a stream of its own rather than as an event
([ADR 0009](../decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md), T16b) — and reaches them
*whole*, since T16c: a subscription begins when it is made, so a service's first lines used to reach
`current.log` and never the ring, and the capture now hands over what it is already holding together
with the subscription rather than only the second of the two. Each task's decisions — and
the four ADRs the work forced — are written up in
[phase-1-process-supervision.md](phase-1-process-supervision.md). **This page does not repeat them.**

**Phase 2 is done, and M2 is reached.** **T20a unblocked it**: PHP 8.3.33 exists
for Windows x86_64, macOS aarch64 and Linux on both architectures, each one run from a directory it
was moved to and made to load an extension there, described by a minisign-signed index at a permanent
URL. The pipeline that produced it is its own repository,
[`mixengine-packages`](https://github.com/mixnz/mixengine-packages), built on GitHub runners
because this project has no macOS or Linux of its own and an artifact nobody can reproduce is one
nobody can audit. **T20 reads that index** — signature checked before the JSON is parsed, cached for
six hours, served stale rather than not at all when the network is gone, and refused when a server
offers a document older than the one already held. **T21 installs what it names**, as one transaction
whose commit is a rename: resumable download, checksum, unpack into a staging directory beside the
destination, a run of the binary itself, and only then the move into place. **T22 is the job system**
— `jobs` rows, the two events, `job.list|status|wait|cancel`, cooperative cancellation, and a boot
that closes what a stopped daemon left running.

Each of those three shipped with nothing able to reach it, deliberately, and **T23 is the method in
front of each**: `runtime.install|uninstall|list_installed|list_available|set_default`, with
`mix runtime` and `mix job` over them. `runtime.install` is the job system's first and only producer
— the call answers a `JobSummary` the moment the row exists, the download reports through the
`Watcher` T21 shaped after `JobHandle`, and what the finished job carries is the same
`RuntimeSummary` a listing is made of. Proved end to end on a real socket against a signed index and
a real archive, in `crates/mixengine-daemon/tests/runtimes.rs` and
`crates/mixengine-cli/tests/runtime.rs`: a version is offered, installed, listed, chosen and removed,
and the directory on disk agrees at every step.

**T24 answers the question the rest of the phase was deferring to**: which version a directory uses.
`core::resolve` walks the four sources in order — a flag or `MIXENGINE_PHP`, the nearest
`mixengine.toml` *that names the language*, a registered project, the kind's default — and answers
with the installed runtime **and the source that decided it**, because "which PHP is this?" is asked
precisely when the answer is surprising. The grammar it needed went to `mixengine-proto` beside the
identifier it is about: `VersionConstraint` (a prefix or a caret) and `RuntimeVersion::cmp_precedence`,
which is a different order from the derived one and the one anything choosing a version wants.
`runtime.resolve` and `mix runtime resolve` are over it.

**T25 is that answer's first caller with no daemon to ask**, and the first binary here that is not a
client of one: `mixengine-shim` reads the name it was invoked by, resolves in its own process against
the database opened read-only, and then *becomes* the program — `exec` on Unix, a child in a Job
Object with the console interrupts swallowed on Windows, the program's own exit code either way.

**T26 gave that binary somewhere to be, and gave the directory it lives in a way onto the PATH**, and
with it **M2 is reached**: `crates/mixengine-shim/tests/shim.rs` runs the real shim out of a `bin/`
that `core::shims::refresh` filled, from two directories, and gets two different PHPs with no daemon
running and no shell hook installed. The two halves keep opposite policies about being done unasked —
`bin/` is a projection of a compiled-in table and is refreshed on every start, while the PATH is a
file in the user's home or a value in their registry hive and is written only by `path.install`. That
split, and the fact that `PathIntegrationApply` came *off* the privileged-operation list rather than
being implemented, are [phase 2](phase-2-runtimes.md)'s to keep.

**T27 is done, and all four languages are in the index**: twenty-five packages and one hundred and
eighteen artifacts, Node.js on five lines, Python on five, Ruby on four. What it cost *here* is three
tests and documentation — the kind enum, the command table, the smoke test and `resolve` were about
four languages rather than about PHP from the start, so every recipe lives in `mixengine-packages`.
Windows on ARM is a runtime target for three of the four now, where `windows.php.net` has never
published one at all. Ruby turned out to be two answers rather than one: RubyInstaller covers Windows
on both architectures, while macOS and Linux were the last cell in the whole table that nothing could
be borrowed for.

**[T27b](phase-2-runtimes.md) closed that cell and audited the packing code doing it.** Ruby is
compiled from ruby-lang.org's own source on all four Unix targets with `--enable-load-relative`, YJIT
on, and — the question the task was carved out to answer — **its own OpenSSL, taught to resolve its
default certificate paths against the loaded `libcrypto`'s location** rather than against the
distribution that built it, which is the same idea as the shim and as `--enable-load-relative`,
applied one library further down. Four rounds of CI and not one of them was Ruby: every failure was
in `relocate.py` or in what a check was asking, which is what a *second* build pipeline is for.

**T29 put a number on the promise the shim is built around, and a `bench` job in CI to keep it.** The
budget belongs to the *resolution* — that is where
[runtime-versions.md](../features/runtime-versions.md) puts it — and the resolution takes 0.58 ms on
macOS, 0.74 ms on Linux and 1.71 ms on Windows against a home with five runtimes in it, nine to
twenty-five times inside its 15 ms. What a person waits for is a different number and is reported
rather than gated, because it is process creation nearly all of it: the shim adds 2.19 ms on Linux
and 4.52 ms on macOS, where it `exec`s, and **15.03 ms on Windows**, where it cannot and starts a
second process instead. **T28 closed the phase.** What it was waiting for had
arrived with [T32](phase-3-services.md) — a pool to reload per PHP version, and a measured
`PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` on all three systems — and what it found was that "prebuilt extension artifacts"
were already inside the archive: the index publishes what each build ships loadable, so the task owed
a switch rather than a second download path. An installed PHP now carries a generated
`etc/php/<version>/conf.d/` that both its pool and the `php` on a terminal read, and
`mix runtime ext enable xdebug` moves one line in it and says what that did to the pool.

**Phase 3 is done — 15 of 15 — and M3 is reached.** The number the milestone asks for exists, is held
to, and was taken on all three systems: `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/warm_start.rs` installs a real
Caddy, MariaDB and Redis into one home and times a single `mix service start`, in the `bench` job,
gating the **median** of five warm rounds at ten seconds. 875 ms on macOS, 2133 ms on Windows,
3189 ms on Linux. Two findings travelled with it, both kept in
[phase 3](phase-3-services.md): the promise was two different runs in one sentence — *fresh install*
and *warm cache* — which [../features/services.md](../features/services.md) now separates; and the
median passes while the **tail** does not, two Linux rounds at 11.8 s and 15.1 s. That tail is one
service rather than the sequential walker everybody would suspect — Caddy and Redis are 300 ms of it
and MariaDB is the rest — which is why the suite now prints the daemon's own account of any round
that goes over.

What the phase established, in one sentence each. **A `services` row is a rendered configuration and
a runnable spec** (T30), from a `Recipe` compiled into the daemon rather than published by the
package index — so a template travels on MixEngine's release schedule and never on the packaging
pipeline's. **Eight of them exist now**: two front ends (T31, T37), a pool that comes out of a
runtime rather than a package (T32), three databases (T33, T34, T34c), two caches (T35). **A user
reaches all of it through shipped methods** — `package.*` and `service.create|delete` (T31a) — which
is why every supervision fixture is now a row the real method wrote. **A port is allocated when a
row is written** (T34c), free means free on the machine, and a port lost to somebody's XAMPP is
reported with that program's name (T38). **Two instances of one server run side by side** (T36),
because every earlier decision keyed itself by service id rather than by package.

**The three refusals the phase added are what it is really made of**, because each one exists only
because the task before it made the mistake possible: a data directory two rows both name (T36), a
runtime uninstalled under a running pool (T32), and a second front end (T37). Each is refused where
it is written down rather than discovered where the files are opened.

**[T37](phase-3-services.md) closed the phase, and its own finding is that "exactly one front end"
had never been a rule anything could break.** With two front-end recipes it is: `Instancing` is
about a package, both of them answer `Single`, and a home obeying both still gets a Caddy and an
nginx rendered against the same 80 and 443. `Recipe::role` is the one distinction that closes it —
`FrontEnd` or `Other`, defaulted to the second — and the refusal reads `core::services::front_end`,
which answers by role so that neither program is the one the code happens to know about. The recipe
itself is Caddy's shape answered by a server with none of Caddy's mechanisms: **nginx has no admin
endpoint, so the template renders one**, because a TCP accept cannot tell a serving nginx from one
whose workers have all died. And the parity the task owed is literal — the arc both front ends walk
is one file, `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/harness/frontend.rs`, driven twice, with each suite reduced
to four constants over it.

**M1 is reached**: a daemon is killed mid-run, and the next one adopts the process that outlived it
and clears the row of the one that did not — `crates/mixengine-daemon/tests/lifecycle.rs`, with the
registry's own tests under it, green on ubuntu, windows and macos rather than on the machine it was
written on. That mattered more here than it did for M0: the reading the whole task rests on is per-OS
(`GetProcessTimes`, `proc_pidinfo`, `/proc/<pid>/stat`), and CI is what found the stop that reached
a process group nobody was leading — right on Windows, silently forgiven on both others.

Stated no louder than that. What the test proves is the *recovery*, on every system: it makes its own
survivors, because what a killed daemon leaves behind is a different thing on each of the three, and
that half is [ADR 0007](../decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md)'s own tests to
keep.

### What is open, and what each one blocks

| Debt | Blocks | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **T41a** does an unsigned binary load under Smart App Control, and does the hosts write survive Defender | **the release, and nothing before it.** Deferred to v0.1.0 on 2026-08-23. It needs one thing, and it is not money: a clean machine with SAC enforced. Everything from T42 on is built on the assumption that the answer is yes. Its remedy half left with **T94**, which is now closed, so what is owed here is these two readings and nothing else | [phase 4](phase-4-sites-and-elevation.md) |
| **T45's fixed link-local address** — `169.254.53.53/32` is not negotiated and nothing detects a machine already using it | nothing; the whole-state shape makes the fix additive | [phase 4](phase-4-sites-and-elevation.md) |
| **M3's tail** — the warm median is inside ten seconds on all three, and two Linux rounds of five were 11.8 s and 15.1 s | nothing. The milestone is reached on the number it named; this is the honest footnote under it, and it is MariaDB's own start on cold I/O rather than the sequential walker | [phase 3](phase-3-services.md) |
| **T69's idle shutdown ships switched off** — no recipe offers a default, so nothing is ever stopped unless somebody asks per service | nothing, and it is a choice rather than an omission: a stopped pool has nothing to start it again until **T70**. Turning it on is four `None`s in four recipes | [phase 7](phase-7-efficiency.md) |
| **Keep-warm reaches a project's PHP pool and not its database** — `kept_warm` joins on `sites.php_service_id` alone | nothing while idle shutdown is off. **Widening it needs no new feature**: `site_service_links` has held the edge since `0006`, which T77 established while reading it for capture — the row used to say the widening waited on T77 | [phase 7](phase-7-efficiency.md) |

**The scaffolding that carried an expiry date has half met it.** `mixengine_testkit::declare` no
longer writes a `services` row: **T31a**'s `service.create` does, over a real socket, so the row every
supervision suite runs against is the one the shipped method writes. What is left of it is the
`packages` row for `fakeservice`, which no index will ever publish and which therefore has no method
to replace it. Its sibling `MIXENGINE_DEV_SPECS` is gone: T30 made a row into a real declaration, and
what a test needs beyond that is a *recipe* for the fixture — one a debug build carries and a release
build does not, and that runs one program rather than whatever a variable named.

**Phase 4 has started, and its elevation half is now built from the bottom to the surface.** The
site model and its four kinds are in (**T39a**), the one-shot helper and its file protocol are in
(**T40**), and **T40a** gave the daemon the one thing that turns a request lying on disk into an
elevated process reading it: an `Elevation` capability on `Host`, with UAC, osascript and pkexec
behind it. **T40b** is the half that decides *when* a prompt is worth spending — a durable queue
whose unique key is the operation itself, one grant slot, `ElevationRequired`, and the degraded mode
a decline leaves behind — and **T64** is the surface over it: `mix elevation grant` prints every
operation and what each will literally change, and only then asks. It refuses to raise anything it
cannot be answered about, which is what a cron job and a CI step look like.

**That stack now has a producer, and MixEngine writes outside `MIXENGINE_HOME` for the first
time.** **T41** made `site.create|update|delete` ask for the machine's hosts file to say what this
home's sites say it should — the whole managed block, never a delta, and only when the disk and the
database actually disagree. The criterion it was written around is one regression test: splice a
block in, replace it, take it out, and the file is byte-identical to the one it started as. The
fixture that used to fill the queue is deleted; both elevation suites now create a site and find an
operation waiting.

**And the machine will now let an unprivileged front end answer on 80 and 443** (**T42**). One
read-only capability says which mechanism this system uses, which port a program must actually bind
to answer 80, and whether the grant is already there; the write is two `PrivilegedOp` variants the
helper validates itself. Windows grants nothing because it reserves nothing, Linux gets
`cap_net_bind_service` written straight as the `security.capability` attribute, and macOS gets a
packet-filter redirect plus the boot-time job that enables pf — the one standing thing MixEngine
installs, argued in [ADR 0012](../decisions/0012-a-boot-time-job-enables-the-packet-filter-on-macos.md). The producer is the daemon's own start-up probe,
which is also the re-probe **T88b** asked for and is what closed it. **T43** then put a front end
behind it: a site file belongs to the front end's own document set, `sites/` is a directory the
recipe declares swept so a removal counts as a change, and a php-fpm site whose pool is gone is left
out rather than failing the render.

**And a home now resolves through its own DNS server** (**T44** built it, **T45** made something send
it a name, and T46a closed with the first). A `hickory-server` on loopback answers `A` for every name
under a managed TLD at any depth, whether or not a site was declared for it — the wildcard that makes
`site.create` cost nothing — and **REFUSES everything else**: no forwarder, no cache, no recursion.
The port is **53535**, not the 5353 three documents named, because 5353 is mDNS's and is held on
every ordinary desktop; `AAAA` is NODATA with an `SOA` rather than `::1`, T41's reasoning applied a
second time.

**T45 is the half that makes the mode real, and every Linux mechanism the documents named was
unusable.** Six rounds of measurement on real runners: a `resolved.conf.d` drop-in with a global
routing domain redirects the **whole machine**, `resolvectl dns lo` is refused by name, a real link
has its servers *replaced*, and NetworkManager is not installed on a stock Ubuntu server. What works
is a `systemd-networkd` dummy link of our own **carrying an address** — without one it is configured,
reports its servers back, and never gets a DNS scope, which is the worst of the four because it reads
as applied. macOS is a marked file per TLD, Windows is one NRPT rule written as registry values
rather than through PowerShell. **The helper is never told where to point**: `127.0.0.1`, the link
and the registry key are compiled into it, and the operation carries only which TLDs and which port.

Two shapes changed with it, and both are corrections rather than costs. **The hosts block is computed
per TLD**, because every mechanism there is scopes to one and `.local` is deliberately never wired —
so a home with `blog.test` and `shop.local` needs a block with exactly one line. And **the wiring is
asked for at daemon start, before any site exists**, which is what makes M4's "zero prompts" true:
ask after the first site and emptying its hosts line is a second operation and therefore a second
prompt. `.internal` joined the managed table on the way, while it was still cheap — the helper is
excluded from auto-update, so a TLD added after a release is refused by every installed copy.

**And a person can now ask what actually happens to one name** (**T46**). `http://blog.test` failing
has four independent causes that look identical from a browser — the name is not declared, no hosts
line was written, no resolver routes the TLD, the server is not answering — so `domain.dns_status`
reports four facts and refuses to collapse them into a verdict, which is what `DnsStatus::wildcards`
had to stop doing one task earlier. The lookup is **`getaddrinfo`, never `nslookup`**, on T45's
measurement that `nslookup` bypasses the NRPT and would report a correctly wired Windows machine as
broken — and it includes the OS cache on purpose, the opposite of what T45's own test needed, because
this asks what a browser sees now rather than whether a mechanism works. `domain.add` and
`domain.remove` came with it: `site.update` could already replace the whole list, but composing one
addition from it is a read-modify-write in a client, and removing a site's primary or its last domain
is refused by name.

**And a person can now ask what is wrong with the machine itself** (**T47a**, the read half of T47).
Nine checks, each read from the subsystem that already owns the answer — the hosts block from T41's
own comparison, the resolver from T45's probe, the domains from T46's report rather than a second
opinion. Two shapes in it are worth more than the checks. **`Note` is not `Problem`**: what MixEngine
can promise about a killed daemon's descendants is total on Windows, the immediate child on Linux and
nothing on macOS, and reporting the macOS answer as a fault would report the operating system as
broken while reporting it as nothing at all is the exact failure [ADR
0007](../decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md) exists to prevent — the same
distinction that keeps `hosts_only` a supported mode rather than a permanent fault. And **a `Problem`
carries a closed id, never advice**, so T47b's repairs cannot drift from this build's findings —
which T47b then spent: its dispatch is an exhaustive `match` with no wildcard arm, so a
condition added later stops the repair compiling until somebody decides what fixing it means.
T47b also found the one thing its own design had backwards: a repair may not enqueue and flush
in one call, because T64's promise is that a person reads the batch **before** it is allowed,
and there is no moment to show it in.
**The check that earns its keep is Windows' reserved port ranges**: a bind into one fails with an
access error, so it reads as a permission problem and sends a person to elevation, UAC and the
firewall, none of which is the answer. It also settled `icacls`, which T3a left open for want of a
caller: the whole of what the caller needs is "is inheritance still severed", `icacls` answers that,
and the 150 lines of `unsafe` FFI buy a trustee comparison nothing asks for.

**One recorded debt from it, and T45 widened it:** two accounts on one machine share a single
`# BEGIN MixEngine` block, and now a single resolver wiring as well — so the second home's desired
state replaces the first's. On Windows the two cannot even be told apart by port, NRPT having no
field for one. A machine-wide lock stops them interleaving
a write, and nothing stops that. **T41a** asks the other open question — whether an unsigned build is
allowed to make this write at all, under Smart App Control and Defender's `HostsFileHijack`
heuristic — and it is now owed against the first release rather than against this phase, because
answering it needs a clean VM, which does not exist yet. The certificate that used to travel with
that question no longer does: **T94** took it to phase 9 and **answered it on 2026-09-04** — no
certificate this project can buy repairs Smart App Control, because the images deciding the outcome
are the borrowed runtimes rather than ours
([ADR 0017](../decisions/0017-smart-app-control-is-an-unsupported-configuration.md)). T42 adds the same
debt in its own shape: on macOS the two homes share one anchor with one pair of redirect targets, so
the second front end will want 8080 too and will fail to bind it.

**Phase 7 is done, and the first two of its tasks are about honesty rather than about saving memory.** **T68** put `ResourceLimits` behind a per-*field* answer about what this machine will
really do with each one, so no client can offer a memory cap that does nothing on macOS. **T69** is
the mechanism the whole phase is named for — a service nothing is using is stopped — and it ships
**switched off**, because stopping a pool is only safe once something starts it again on the next
request and that is T70. What it added instead is everything that has to be right before a default
can be turned on: a `ConnectionCount` capability on all three systems, a probe reading beside `ready`
and `health` in the supervisor, a sweeper that spends a policy in *observations* rather than in
elapsed time — a suspended laptop counts none of the night — and a rule every layer repeats, that a
service which could not be measured is never stopped. `services.idle_minutes` therefore has three
states today and not two, so that T70's default can reach the home that never touched the setting
without reaching the one whose owner switched it off. The rest, including the query counter the
roadmap asked for and `ServiceSpec` cannot carry, is
[phase 7](phase-7-efficiency.md)'s to keep. **T70** and **T70a** are the something that starts a
service again — the request or the connection that found it stopped — which is what let idle
shutdown be turned on at all. **T71** is the measuring: two sampling rates in one loop, because
*"sampled only while watched"* and *"a history that says what was eating my battery last night"*
cannot both be true, and the night is the half nobody is watching.

**Both published numbers are now measured rather than promised**, which is what closes M7. **T72**
gates `mixengined` idle under 36 MB and reports the 60 MB total beside it, because two thirds of
that total is a Go program this project neither wrote nor tunes. **T72a** gates the cold path at
1.5 s — met at 108 ms on Linux, 129 ms on macOS and 574 ms on Windows — and the task it took to get
there is the phase's own lesson twice over: the roadmap entry described work T70 had already done,
while the thing actually missing was a pool on a socket having no way to be *asked* whether anybody
was using it. Two defects surfaced only once a real request went through: a counter rule that was
reading the daemon's own health checks as traffic, and an activator that was bound at boot and
therefore never for a pool installed afterwards. Neither was visible from reading the code.
**T73** closed the phase, and it is the one task here that changed no mechanism at all: the three
database templates were rendering the values their servers would have used with no configuration
file, under a feature document that said they were tuned. What it refused is worth as much as what
it changed — `max_connections` saves nothing at idle and buys a new way for a busy afternoon to
fail, and an idle php-fpm pool is already stopped, so a smaller one would only slow down the machine
while somebody is using it.

**Both promises are kept.** `runtime.uninstall` refuses over a running php-fpm pool (**T32**) and
over a registered project whose pin the removal would leave with no answer (**T39**), and `--force`
crosses the second and never the first — a broken pin is a statement about the next `cd`, a running
pool is a process serving requests now.

## Working on this file

- Tick a task in **its phase file**, not here; update the `Done` column when a phase moves.
- New work goes into the phase file where it belongs in the order. Give it the next free suffix on
  the task it follows (`T40a`, `T40b`) rather than renumbering anything after it. A task may be
  lettered after the one it is ordered *before* — T19c and T20a both are — as long as it says so.
- A phase file carries its own goal, legend and milestone so it reads on its own.
- **One note, one place.** A decision that is *in* the code — why this type, why this order, why not
  the obvious alternative — belongs in the doc comment beside it. One that crosses crates belongs in
  an [ADR](../decisions/). What a phase file carries is only what neither can: what a task
  deliberately did **not** do, and which later task is expected to. A note that would still be true
  with the code deleted is a note the phase file should keep; one that merely describes the code is
  one the code should be carrying instead.
- **"Where we are" is the current phase and the open debts, and nothing else.** Not a changelog. A
  finished task is described by its phase file and by the code it landed, and a third telling is two
  more places for the story to go stale in. Keep this section under a screen; when a phase closes,
  its paragraphs go, they do not accumulate.
