# Plans and specs

`docs/superpowers/` holds two folders that look alike and are treated very differently.

## `specs/` — tracked, linkable

Design documents (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug-design.md`). They describe what a feature is and why it is
shaped that way, and they outlive the work. They are committed, they go to the remote, and any
document may link to them.

## `plans/` — local only, never referenced

Step-by-step implementation plans (`YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md`). They are scaffolding for one stretch of
work: long, quickly stale, and meaningless once the branch lands. They are gitignored — they exist
on the machine that wrote them and nowhere else.

**Never link to a file under `plans/`.** Not from `AGENT.md`, `.agent/`, `README.md`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, a commit message, a PR body, or a code comment. A link to a path nobody else has
is a dead link for every other reader.

When you want to point at the reasoning behind a feature, point at its spec, or record the decision
in [.agent/decisions/](../decisions/). If something in a plan is worth keeping, move it into a
spec, a decision or a convention — do not leave it in the plan and link there.
