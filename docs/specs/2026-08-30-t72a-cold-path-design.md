# T72a — A pool on a socket that can be idle-stopped, and a budget on the first request

Roadmap: [.claude/roadmap/phase-7-efficiency.md](../../../.claude/roadmap/phase-7-efficiency.md).
Feature: [.claude/features/resource-isolation.md](../../../.claude/features/resource-isolation.md),
"Cold path". Standard:
[.claude/standards/testing.md](../../../.claude/standards/testing.md), "Performance guards".
Predecessors: [T69](2026-08-26-t69-idle-detection-design.md), whose sweeper and whose unused
`HttpCounter` this finishes; [T70](2026-08-29-t70-on-demand-activation-design.md), whose activator
the first request walks through; [T72](2026-08-30-t72-ci-budgets-design.md), which split this out and
whose D4 and D5 are built here.

## What this is for

One published number is still not measured anywhere: **the first request to a stopped site is served
in under 1.5 s**. T72 gated the other one and left this, on the finding that on two systems of three
there is no *stopped site* for a first request to arrive at. This task makes there be one, and then
gates the number on all three.

Milestone **M7**'s second half is claimed when this lands, and not before.

## What T72 got wrong, and what is actually missing

**T72's diagnosis names three things and only one of them is true.** It says that on Linux and macOS
`activation_port_needed`, `activator` and `held_while_stopped` all answer nothing, so a pool is never
idle-stopped and nothing would wake it. Read against the code:

- `activation_port_needed` answering `false` on a socket is **correct and deliberate** — there is no
  number to allocate, which is exactly what the trait's own documentation says it means.
- `activator` **does** answer for a socket pool, and has since T70:
  `recipes.rs`'s `activator_socket` derives `php-fpm-8.3.activate.sock` beside the pool's own socket,
  and `php_fpm.rs`'s own test asserts it in as many words — *"a socket pool derives its activator and
  needs no row; a TCP pool cannot"*. The daemon binds it at boot through `activate::hold_all`, and
  both site templates already render it as the second upstream under `lb_policy first`.
- `held_while_stopped` being empty for php-fpm is **correct and deliberate**, and its own
  documentation says why: a pool has a front end in front of it, so it gets a permanent activator
  instead of having its own address held.

So the roadmap's instruction — *hold the socket while the pool is stopped, render it as the site's
second upstream* — describes work that was finished by T70 and T70a. **What is actually missing is one
line**: `php_fpm.rs`'s `idle_probe` is `context.port().map(...)`, and a pool on a socket has no port.
No probe means `generate.rs` attaches no `IdlePolicy` — *"a recipe that declares no probe is never
idle-stopped however its row is set"* — so the pool runs forever and there is nothing to wake.

**T69 recorded the same fact from the other side** (*"a php-fpm pool on a Unix socket is never
idle-stopped"*) and T72 inferred the wrong cause for it. This task fixes the cause, and corrects both
documents that carry the wrong one.

## D1 — The probe asks php-fpm, and asks it over the pool's own socket

`IdleProbe` counts TCP connections, and there is no cross-platform way to count connections to a Unix
socket: Linux publishes them in `/proc/net/unix` — measured, one row per connection with the path on
it — but macOS's `lsof` has no state filter for a Unix socket the way `-sTCP:ESTABLISHED` is one for a
port, and the honest alternative there is `libproc` through FFI. **So the question is not put to the
operating system at all. It is put to php-fpm**, which has kept the answer since PHP 5: the pool
config gains

    pm.status_path = /mixengine-status

and the daemon asks for it by speaking FastCGI to the pool's own socket. **No per-OS code, on any of
the three systems** — which is why this task loses the roadmap's **(P)** marker.

**`pm.status_listen` is deliberately not used, and that decision is this design's sharpest.** A status
listener of its own would be strictly better arithmetic — measured, a probe over it leaves `accepted
conn` untouched and reads `active processes` as 0 — but it exists only **from PHP 8.0**
([php-src `PHP-8.0/UPGRADING`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/php/php-src/PHP-8.0/UPGRADING)), and
an unknown directive is not ignored by php-fpm: `php-fpm --test` refuses the file, so the pool would
not start. MixEngine offers **PHP from 7.0 upwards on purpose** — `mixengine-packages`' `eol.json`
argues it at length: *"the people who reach for a local development environment rather than a
container are very often the people maintaining something old"*. A design that idle-stops 8.x and
leaves 7.4 running forever abandons exactly the person that sentence is about, and a design that
branches on the version has two definitions of *idle* in one feature.

The case `pm.status_listen` was added for — its own changelog says *"useful for getting status when
all children are busy with serving long running requests"* — is a case this sweeper does not need
solved. When every worker is busy the probe queues and times out, which is `Unmeasurable`, which
means **the pool is not stopped**. That is the answer the correct arithmetic would have produced
anyway.

**The status path must not end in `.php`.** Both front ends hand FastCGI only what matches `.php` —
Caddy's `php_fastcgi` after its `try_files` rewrite, nginx's `location ~ \.php$` — so no URL from
outside can produce a `SCRIPT_NAME` equal to `/mixengine-status`. That is an argument, not a
measurement, so D5 turns it into a test rather than leaving it here.

**Every existing home restarts its pools once.** The pool file changes, `document::install` sees the
change, and the pool is restarted to pick it up. Said here rather than discovered by a user.

## D2 — What "idle" means, and why it takes two readings

Measured against php-fpm 8.3.6, a pool on a socket with `pm = static`, `pm.max_children = 5`:

| | idle | one 1.5 s request in flight | the sample after it, same request |
|---|---|---|---|
| `accepted conn` | previous **+ 1** | previous + 2 | previous + 1 |
| `active processes` | 1 | 2 | 2 |

A probe is itself a request, so it costs exactly one `accepted conn` and occupies exactly one worker
— stable across every reading taken. This section originally concluded that **idle is
`accepted conn == previous + 1` and `active processes <= 1`, and needs both halves**, because each
covers what the other cannot: the counter sees traffic *between* two sweeps, and `active processes`
sees a request *spanning* them.

### Amended during implementation: the counter is unusable, and the reason is ours

**The table above was measured against a bare pool. Against a pool the daemon is supervising, the
counter never advances by one.** A pool's health check is a connect-and-close on the same socket
every ten seconds, and **php-fpm counts a bare connection as an accepted one** — measured: three
connect-and-closes plus one probe move the counter by four. Between two thirty-second sweeps there
are always about three health checks, so the delta is never 1 and every pool reads as busy for ever.
The first run of `cold_path.rs` did exactly that: it waited out its whole four-minute budget with
three pools that would never be stopped.

**The daemon was reading its own footprints.** Two ways out were weighed:

- *Subtract what the daemon itself dialled.* Correct, and rejected: it makes every future caller that
  dials a pool something that has to be counted somewhere, and a rule that silently goes wrong when
  somebody forgets is worse than one that never depended on it.
- *Judge `active processes` alone.* Taken.

**So idle is `active processes <= 1`, and nothing else.** The `<= 1` is still the probe's own worker.
The rule is immune to health checks, to `mix doctor`, and to anything else that opens a connection
without asking the pool to run something — because what it measures is not connections at all, but
whether a worker is *serving*.

**What that costs, stated rather than hidden.** Traffic between two readings is invisible, so a site
being used in short bursts can look idle at every sample and be stopped. The cost is one cold path:
the next request wakes the pool through its activator, inside the budget D6 gates — measured at
**140 ms against a 1.5 s budget**, which is what makes this trade affordable. What it never costs is
a request in flight: a pool serving something is exactly what `active processes` sees.

This also removes the state D3 was about — the probe compares nothing across sweeps, so `Counters`
keeps the shape `HttpCounter` gave it.

**Anything that is not a clean reading is `Unmeasurable`, never idle.** A refused dial, a timeout, a
body that is not JSON, a JSON without `active processes` in it. That is `ConnectionCount`'s
documented rule, which this task does not weaken: *"reading I could not measure as there is nothing
to measure stops a service somebody is using"*. **A pool whose every worker is busy cannot answer
the probe at all**, which times out, which keeps it running — the right answer arrived at by the
mechanism rather than by a special case.

**The first sample after a pool starts is never idle**, and this needs no new code: `observe`'s
existing arm already folds "no baseline" into "busy", with the reason written down — *"a service with
no baseline is one this build cannot call idle, and saying so as busy is the answer that keeps it
running"*.

## D3 — One variant, and less new code than the task looked like

`IdleProbe::HttpCounter` is **not unused**: T69 implemented it fully, including `Counters` (the
per-service memory of the last reading), the no-baseline rule above, and `counter_in`, whose own
documentation names the endpoint it was written for — *"php-fpm's `?json`"*. T69 anticipated this
road; what it could not do was reach php-fpm, which does not speak HTTP.

So the shape of the change is small:

- **`mixengine-proto`**: `IdleProbe::FastCgiStatus { socket: PathBuf, path: String }`. Not a
  general address: Windows has no use for it (below), so a socket is all it can carry, and a variant
  that cannot express a wrong thing is better than one that can.
- **`mixengine-supervisor`**: one more arm in `observe`, reading one field and judging it with a pure
  function. **`Counters` is untouched** — this was written expecting the opposite, that the value
  would have to grow from a number into a per-probe reading so the sweeper could remember
  `accepted conn` and the `start time` it went with. D2's amendment removed the need: a probe that
  compares nothing across sweeps remembers nothing.
- **`mixengine-core`**: `php_fpm.rs`'s `idle_probe` answers the new variant on the socket arm; the
  template gains one line; the status path is a constant beside `POOL_FILE`.
- **`mixengine-cli`**: one arm in `render.rs`'s `probe`, so `mix service show` can say what it is
  watching.

**Windows keeps `Connections { port }` and that is not a compromise.** It runs `php-cgi.exe -b addr`,
which is not php-fpm and publishes no status; and it already has a working probe, a real port and an
allocated activation port. The two systems measure *idle* by different mechanisms for the same
service, which is the same shape `LimitSupport` has: ask the platform what it can answer, rather than
insisting all three answer alike.

## D4 — Where the FastCGI client lives

`mixengine-supervisor/src/fastcgi.rs`, beside `http.rs` for the same reason `http.rs` is there: the
thing that needs it is `observe`. Async, one `BEGIN_REQUEST` / `PARAMS` / empty `STDIN`, records read
until `END_REQUEST`, under `idle.rs`'s existing `PATIENCE` (2 s) rather than a deadline of its own —
one sweep's patience is one number, and a probe that outlived it would delay the sweep it belongs to.
It
dials through `mixengine_platform::activation::dial`, which is the call the activator already makes,
so this crate gains no `#[cfg]`.

**There is already a FastCGI client in this workspace** — `mixengine-testkit`'s, 298 lines, blocking,
written for `php_fpm.rs`'s suite. It cannot be the one the daemon uses: testkit is a dev-dependency
and `workspace_layering.rs` enforces that. Two encoders of one protocol is a drift risk this design
accepts, with its eyes open and for a bounded reason: the record header has been eight fixed bytes
since 1996, both sides have tests, and the alternative — a `mixengine-testkit` → `mixengine-supervisor`
edge added so a pure encoder can be shared — buys less than a new edge in the layering costs. If the
implementation finds the sharing cheaper than this paragraph predicts, take it and amend this note.

## D5 — The status path is proved unreachable, not argued unreachable

An integration test through a real front end: `GET /mixengine-status` against a served site must
answer **404**, and must not answer php-fpm's JSON. D1's argument for why it cannot is the kind this
repository requires a measurement for — and the exposure is a real one now that the status page
shares the socket the sites use, where `pm.status_listen` would have made it structural.

## D6 — The cold path suite, and the contradiction it has to settle

`crates/mixengine-cli/tests/cold_path.rs`, in the shape T72's D4 already argued: **three pools, three
sites, one sweep**. A round is a single `GET` to a site whose pool is stopped, timed to the last byte,
asserting 200, asserting the body is what the PHP prints, and asserting the pool was `stopped` before
and `running` after. The pool must have been stopped **by the sweeper** — a service a person stopped
is one the activator refuses to wake, deliberately (T70 D8) — so the suite sets an idle policy and
waits for a sweep.

**T72's D4 and D5 do not agree, and this settles it.** D4 wants three pools; D5 adds one PHP to the
`bench` job's fetch step. Three pools means three `runtime_installs`, which means **three PHP
versions fetched**. The alternative — one PHP, three rounds, a fresh wait before each — costs about a
minute per round on every OS leg, and buys nothing.

The reason for three rounds is stronger than T72's *"the second and third are more realistic"*: **a
single CI measurement has already misled this project once** — the warm-start bench is bimodal on
ubuntu, and a red there has meant a bad minute rather than a regression. Three numbers admit a
median. That is the argument, and realism is the bonus.

**And the three versions are chosen rather than convenient: 7.0.33, 7.4.33, 8.3.33.** All three are
published for all three runners. The first is the floor of the range this product offers, the second
is the legacy version people actually still run, and the third is what the `test` job already pins.
Two of the three predate `pm.status_listen` entirely, so this bench is also **the standing proof of
D1's decision** — the day somebody reaches for the cleaner arithmetic, two thirds of this measurement
go red rather than a paragraph being disbelieved.

**Two things about fetching them.** `fetch-package.sh` unpacks into `$RUNNER_TEMP/<kind>`, so three
PHPs would overwrite one another — it needs the directory to be the caller's choice. And it hardcodes
`tar.zst` for Linux, while **PHP 7.0.33 and 7.4.33 publish `tar.gz` there** (checked against the
release assets); the extension has to come from what is published rather than from the runner alone.

Gated at **1.5 s**, release-only, printed in debug — `idle_footprint.rs`'s shape exactly. The step
runs **before M3**, on T72's finding that a failing step ends its job and the cheap independent
measurement should not be lost behind somebody else's flake.

## D6a — Amended during implementation: a hole in T70, found by measuring it

**The second run of `cold_path.rs` answered 502**, with three pools correctly asleep and a site that
could not be woken. The cause is T70's and had been invisible since it landed:
`activate::hold_all` runs **once, at daemon start**. A pool created after that — which is every pool,
since `runtime install` is what creates them — has no activator bound until the next restart.

In a real home that is: install PHP, work for half an hour, watch the site start answering 502, and
have no way to know that restarting the daemon fixes it. The site file names the activator either
way, so nothing looks wrong anywhere.

**The fix is the repair `activation::ensure` already models** — run at boot *and* after an install,
both idempotent — extended to the address as well as the port. It needs one piece of bookkeeping:
`Activation::bind` on an address this same daemon already holds fails with `AddrInUse`, so a second
pass would log every existing activator as an address something else took. A process-wide set of what
is already held makes the second call a no-op for everything the first one bound.

**This is inside T72a rather than a task of its own** because without it the cold path does not work
for any pool a user installed, and the budget would be gating an arrangement nobody reaches.

## D7 — What this task does not do

- **No API and no CLI addition.** `service.set_idle`, `site.create` and `metrics.snapshot` are all
  T69's, T70's and T71's.
- **No probe for the databases.** They listen on a port on every system and their existing probe is
  correct; nothing here reaches them.
- **No `pm.status_listen`, on any version.** D1.
- **No tuning.** If 1.5 s is missed, this task writes down what it measured and raises it; making the
  wake faster is T73's.
- **No change to Windows.** Its cold path already worked and is already measurable.

## Testing

- **Unit, in `mixengine-supervisor`**: the framing and the read, against a fixture that speaks the
  protocol back on a loopback port — so it is exercised on Windows too, where a pool never has this
  probe. Plus D2's rule as a pure function: one busy worker is the probe's own and is idle, two is
  busy; and a pool nothing is listening on is `Unmeasurable` rather than idle.
- **Unit, in `mixengine-core`**: the socket arm renders `FastCgiStatus` and the Windows arm renders
  `Connections`; the probe names the address `listen` computed rather than a second one; the rendered
  pool file carries the status path and carries no `pm.status_listen`; the status path does not end
  in `.php`.
- **Integration, `php_fpm.rs`**: against a real PHP, a pool answers its status page over FastCGI and
  the probe costs exactly one `accepted conn` with one active worker. **Run against 7.0.33 as well as
  8.3.33**, which is the evidence for D1's version decision.
- **Integration, `php_site.rs`**: D5's 404, and beneath it the first request in this repository that
  goes through a front end and comes back from PHP. **Both were mutation-checked**: pointing
  `STATUS_PATH` at `/index.php` turns the 404 test red, so it is not passing for want of a route.
- **Bench, `cold_path.rs`**: D6.

## Documents to update

- [.claude/features/resource-isolation.md](../../../.claude/features/resource-isolation.md) — the
  "Cold path" bullet stops saying *"it is given no activator"*, which is wrong, and the criterion
  *"a request to an idle site succeeds within the cold-path budget"* stops being a promise.
- [.claude/roadmap/phase-7-efficiency.md](../../../.claude/roadmap/phase-7-efficiency.md) — T72's
  entry gains one correcting sentence rather than being rewritten (it is a record of what was
  believed), T72a is ticked with the measured numbers and loses its **(P)**.
- [.claude/standards/testing.md](../../../.claude/standards/testing.md) — the cold-path guard joins
  the other three in the same shape.
- [.claude/operations/build-and-release.md](../../../.claude/operations/build-and-release.md) — the
  `bench` job grows a step and two PHP fetches.

No ADR. The number was argued for long before this task, and asking a service about itself rather
than asking the operating system about it is within `mixengine-platform`'s rule rather than an
exception to it.

## Order of work

1. `fastcgi.rs` in the supervisor, with its own tests against captured records.
2. The `FastCgiStatus` variant, the `observe` arm, and D2's four unit tests.
3. `php_fpm.rs`: the probe arm, the template line, the constant — and the `php_fpm.rs` integration
   test that proves the counter advances by one.
4. D5's front-end test.
5. `cold_path.rs`, measured and printed, **not yet gated**; the `bench` job's three PHP fetches and
   its step.
6. **One CI run to read three numbers**, on three systems.
7. Turn the gate on at 1.5 s — or, if a system cannot meet it, write down what it measured and raise
   it as a product decision rather than editing the number.
8. The four documents, and the roadmap entry with the numbers in it.
