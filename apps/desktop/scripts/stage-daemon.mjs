/**
 * Stage the four headless binaries beside the window, then run `tauri dev` — T111.
 *
 * The window looks for `mixengined` in its own directory first (T107), and `tauri dev` starts it
 * out of src-tauri/target/debug/, where nothing else ever puts a daemon. So the MixEngine tab of a
 * development window either showed the *not installed* gate or, on a machine with a release
 * installed, found *that* daemon at the second step and started it against the wrong home — the
 * release default is `MixEngine`, a build out of cargo defaults to `MixEngine-dev` (ADR 0024), and
 * the gate then never leaves "not running".
 *
 * Four things, then `tauri dev`:
 *
 *   1. read MIX_BINARIES/MIX_CRATES out of packaging/common.sh, minus the window;
 *   2. `cargo build -p …` the four crates at the repository root, debug profile, like the window —
 *      cargo rebuilds only what changed, so an unchanged tree costs a second. A build that fails
 *      ends the script here, with the running daemon left alone;
 *   3. stop this checkout's daemon with `mix daemon stop`, **always** — it outlives its window by
 *      design, and a window that finds it still answering talks to the old code. Asking a home
 *      with no daemon to stop is a no-op;
 *   4. copy the four into src-tauri/target/debug/, unconditionally — a stale daemon beside a fresh
 *      window is the mismatch this script exists to remove, and comparing timestamps to skip a
 *      copy that takes milliseconds buys nothing.
 *
 * **The stop used to wait for the copy to fail**, which only Windows and Linux do — they refuse to
 * overwrite a running executable. macOS lets it happen, so there the old daemon was never stopped
 * and every `npm run dev:app` after a daemon change went on running the previous build (found
 * 2026-09-19). Stopping unconditionally is the same on all three systems.
 *
 * `tauri dev` is started from here rather than by `&&` in package.json so that one environment
 * reaches both it and `mix daemon stop`: two commands joined by `&&` are two processes, and an
 * environment set in the first does not survive into the second.
 *
 * **This script picks no home** — T166, ADR 0040. It passes MIXENGINE_DEV_HOME, the same
 * suggestion the root .cargo/config.toml gives everything cargo runs, and the binaries decide:
 * the checkout's .mixengine-home, unless an elevated helper could not read it there (a checkout on
 * an external disk, on macOS), in which case the default home. Deciding here as well would be a
 * second copy of that rule, in a language the daemon does not speak. A MIXENGINE_HOME already set
 * still wins, as it does for cargo.
 *
 * Node and not bash: `npm run dev:app` is typed into PowerShell, and on a Windows machine with WSL
 * a bare `bash` is System32\bash.exe, which is WSL's. The other scripts in packaging/ are run from
 * Git Bash on purpose; `npm run` is not.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run dev:app
 *   node scripts/stage-daemon.mjs --stage-only     # build and copy, no window
