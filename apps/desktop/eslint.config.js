/**
 * What only a linter can say.
 *
 * Deliberately not the recommended sets. `tsc` already runs `strict`, `noUnusedLocals` and
 * `noUnusedParameters`, and it runs on every push; a second opinion about the same things would be
 * noise. What is here is what the compiler cannot see:
 *
 * - **Hook dependencies.** A `useCallback` that closes over `t` and does not list it keeps the
 *   dictionary it was built with, so an error raised after the user switches language comes out in
 *   the old one. That compiles perfectly.
 * - **The module boundary.** `src/components`, `src/core`, `src/icons`, `src/shell` and `src/i18n`
 *   know nothing about `modules/db`, `modules/rest` or `modules/terminal`. A `Button` importing
 *   from a module type-checks; this is what says no, and it says it in the editor rather than in
 *   CI ten minutes later.
 *
 * `.agent/conventions/adding-a-module.md` is where the boundary rule is written down. The two
 * exceptions below are the point of it: `shell/registry.ts` joins a module to the tab bar and
 * `i18n/dicts.ts` joins its strings to the dictionary, one line each per module.
