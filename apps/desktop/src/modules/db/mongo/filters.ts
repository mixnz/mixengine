 * Every operator a document filter can use, in the order the dropdown offers them. Each `id` is
 * what the backend matches on (`build_filter` in `src-tauri/src/db/mongo.rs`) and also names its
 * label under `noSqlTable.op.*` — an operator added here needs an entry in both.
 *
 * Mostly the SQL set, with the differences Mongo forces: no `LIKE`, since a regex says the same
 * thing and is what the driver actually takes, and `exists` / `notExists` / `type` added, because
 * in a schemaless collection "the field isn't there" and "the field is null" are two different
 * questions and only Mongo can be asked either.
