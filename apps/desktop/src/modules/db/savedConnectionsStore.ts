 * The saved connection list, shared by every tab.

 * Each tab used to read the list for itself — `connections.json`, then one credential-store lookup
 * per connection, all of it again per tab — and then kept its own copy. Two things came of that: a
 * connection saved in one tab stayed invisible in the others until the app was restarted, and a
 * newly opened tab spent that first read showing an empty sidebar, which widens as the names
 * arrive and shoves the form sideways.
 *
 * The list is one thing on disk, so it is one thing in memory: read once, written through here,
 * and handed to every tab that asks. A tab opened later renders the finished list on its first
 * frame — there is nothing left to arrive.
