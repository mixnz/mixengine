 * Those four differ from every other wait in the app: an external tool is doing the work, it can
 * run for minutes, and nothing in the connection can be touched while it does. So unlike
 * LoadingOverlay's one quiet line over a single panel, this one dims the whole workspace, states
 * in plain size what is happening, and says the wait is expected — otherwise a locked tab reads
 * as a hung one.
 *
 * It covers its nearest positioned ancestor, which is the workspace: the tab bar and the other
 * connections stay live, so a long dump in one tab never holds up work in another.
