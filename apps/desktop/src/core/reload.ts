 * `Ctrl+R` — `⌘R` on a Mac — taken off the webview and handed to the pane on screen.
 *
 * Every content pane in the app carries a reload button, and `Ctrl+R` is the key a user reaches for
 * to press it — except that the webview underneath answers first and reloads the whole app, which
 * drops every open connection, every unsaved query draft and every staged edit with it. So the
 * gesture is intercepted here: in a packaged build none of the reload keys reach the webview at
 * all, and the plain one presses the reload button of whichever pane the user is looking at.
 *
 * The hard reload and `F5` stay live under `npm run dev:app`: that build is being edited while it
 * runs, and taking away the developer's own way of picking up a change would be no kindness.
 * `Ctrl+R` is claimed there too, so what is being developed against is the behaviour that ships.

 * right to — a pane knows things about its own state that a modal count does not, and the flag
 * reads the same as the `disabled` on the button beside it.

 * reloads me, and the name is where that fact and its reasons are written down.
