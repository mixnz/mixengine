/**
 * A table that only ever holds the rows you can see.
 *
 * The machinery is shared because the fault it fixes is shared: a grid that builds every row into
 * the DOM is a grid that lays every row out again on every event that touches it — and a tab behind
 * another tab is `display: none`, which keeps no layout at all, so simply coming back to it pays
 * the whole cost. A few hundred rows is where that stops being instant.
 *
 * Two things have to be true for a window of rows to work, and both are the caller's to arrange
 * (see {@link useVirtualRows} for the first and {@link measureColumns} for the second):
 *
 * - **Every row is exactly `rowHeight` tall.** The rows outside the window are stood in for by a
 *   spacer of `count × rowHeight`, so any difference between that and a drawn row's real height
 *   makes the table's total height depend on where it is scrolled — the end of the set drifts away
 *   as you scroll towards it, by an amount that scales with the set. The height is therefore
 *   *stated* and pinned by the stylesheet, never measured: measuring can only make the error small,
 *   and small times ten thousand is not small.
 * - **Every column has a width of its own.** Only a few dozen rows are in the DOM at a time, and a
 *   table left to size itself sizes itself around those — every scroll would find new widest
 *   values and shuffle the columns sideways under the pointer.
 *
 * There are two ways to give a column a width, and the grids here use both, because they hold
 * different things:
 *
 * - **Measured** ({@link measureColumns}): the text is measured against a canvas and the widths are
 *   pinned with a colgroup and `table-layout: fixed`. Cheap over any number of rows — no elements,
 *   no layout — and right for a grid whose cells are text and nothing else. It has to be told about
 *   anything that is *not* text, which is why it takes `headerExtra`.
 * - **A sizer row**: a row of no height, holding each column's widest value, left in the table for
 *   the browser's own layout to find. Nothing is measured or pinned; the table sizes itself as it
 *   always did, around a row that is always present and always the widest. That is what suits a
 *   grid whose cells hold badges, buttons and several fonts — describing all of that to a canvas is
 *   how it gets it wrong, and the browser already knows.
 *
 * A grid wide enough needs the same treatment sideways ({@link useVirtualColumns}), and for the
 * same arithmetic: what a grid costs is rows times columns, so windowing one of the two leaves the
 * other free to put the cost back. Fifty rows of two hundred columns is ten thousand cells whether
 * or not the rows were windowed down to fifty.
