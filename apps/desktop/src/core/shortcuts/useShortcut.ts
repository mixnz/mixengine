/**
 * Answers `id` for as long as `enabled` says this pane is the one being looked at.
 *
 * `enabled` is what keeps a chord unambiguous: every connection tab stays mounted behind the one
 * on show, and each of their grids would otherwise answer the same keystroke together.
 *
 * `handler` is read at the moment the key is pressed rather than when the listener was registered,
 * so it may close over state freely — a pane mid-request checks for that inside it, exactly as its
 * button's `disabled` does.
 *
 * **When two panes claim the same chord, the one that registered last wins** — see `decide`, which
 * orders by registration and not by the catalogue. That order is React's effect order: children
 * before parents, and within a parent the order the elements are written in. So `rest.closeRequest`
 * beats `app.closeTab` on `Ctrl+W` because the REST pane is a child of the shell, not because
 * anything says so.
 *
 * Which is worth knowing before relying on it. Two shortcuts that share a chord and are enabled
 * together are a clash — DEV logs one — and the tie is broken by where the components happen to
 * sit. Moving a `useShortcut` call above another in the same component silently changes which one
 * runs. If a pair ever needs an order that does not follow from the tree, the answer is for the
 * outer one to turn its `enabled` off while the inner one is up, which states the intent instead of
 * inheriting it.

 * the window listener below is never reached at all: `Ctrl+W` went to the shell and the tab stayed
 * open. A terminal therefore has to ask the question from inside xterm's handler and step aside for
