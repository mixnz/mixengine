 * every render, and a `setTabs` that always allocates turns the pair into a render loop that
 * React stops with "Maximum update depth exceeded". Bailing out here breaks the loop for every

 * second connection. What decides it is the module's own `singleTab` — see {@link ModuleDefinition}
 * — and MixEngine is the one that sets it, because two of its tabs are two views of the one daemon
 * this window was opened to drive.
 *
 * Everything that offers a new tab reads this: the `[+]` button and its menu, `Ctrl/Cmd+T`, the
 * number chords, and the shortcut table that lists them. An empty result is a window with nothing
 * left to open, and the button is not drawn at all — the close button then stands alone, and
 * closing the last tab replaces it, which is how such a window reloads its module.
 *
 * Derived on every render rather than kept: the visible list changes with the profile and the tabs
 * change with every click, and a remembered answer to a question this cheap is an answer that goes
 * out of date somewhere nobody is looking.
