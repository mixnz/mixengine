 * and not after the position, so anything that ever files against one — a remap screen — outlives a
 * profile change.
 *
 * **`Workspace.tsx` may not loop over this.** Its `useShortcut` calls have to be the same count on
 * every render, and this list shrinks with the profile; the loop there is over the registry, and it
 * passes `enabled` instead. See the note beside it.

/**
 * Every chord in the app, the shell's and the visible modules'.
 *
 * Assembled here rather than inside `core/shortcuts/`: that folder is the mechanism and may not
 * import from `shell/` or `modules/` at all — see `.agent/architecture/frontend.md`. The
 * dispatcher is handed this list; it never goes looking for one.
 *
 * A hidden module contributes nothing: its panes are never mounted, so nothing would answer its
 * chords, and the shortcut table draws exactly this list.
 *
 * `openable` is the same list narrowed to the modules a new tab can still be opened of — see
 * `openableModules` in `shell/tabs.ts`. It decides one thing: whether `app.newTab` is here at all.
 * A module's own number key is always here, because a module with nothing left to open answers it
 * by going to the tab it has. Defaults to the whole of `visible`, which is what a window with no
 * tabs in it yet would pass.
 *
 * **The result must be memoized by the caller.** It was a module-level constant until T108 made it
 * a function of the visible modules; `useShortcutDispatcher` rebinds its listener whenever the
 * array's identity changes, and the Settings table is handed the very same value so the two cannot
 * come to disagree.
