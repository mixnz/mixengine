/**
 * Which modules this window draws, decided before anything is drawn.
 *
 * A gate and not a branch inside the workspace, because `Workspace` settles its whole initial state
 * in `useState` initializers — which tabs to restore, which of them is active, which one to mount —
 * and every one of those reads the visible module list. Something that has to run before a
 * component's first render is that component's parent.
 *
 * `deciding` lasts one IPC round trip and happens on exactly one launch in the life of a machine —
 * a webview profile with no shell settings in it at all. It draws nothing rather than a spinner: a
 * spinner that appears and vanishes inside a frame is worse than a blank window that does not.
