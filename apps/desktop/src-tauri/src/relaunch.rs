//! Starting this window again — roadmap tasks **T106** and **T187**.
//!
//! Two callers: the ErrorBoundary's *Restart app*, and MixLab's own updater (`crate::updater`),
//! coming back on the new version after it has replaced this executable underneath the running
//! process.
//!
//! # Three things here are not obvious
//!
//! **The path is read once, at startup.** On Linux `std::env::current_exe` reads `/proc/self/exe`,
//! which follows the *inode* and not the name: after the swap has renamed `mixlab` to `mixlab.old`
//! and written a new `mixlab`, a running window asking afterwards is told its own path is
//! `…/mixlab.old`. Relaunching that is relaunching the version the user just replaced, with nothing
//! anywhere to say so. So [`remember`] runs on the first line of `run()`, before an update can have
//! happened, and [`origin`] is what everything else reads.
//!
//! **A relaunched copy must not hand its start back to the copy it is replacing.** `run()`'s second
//! act is `launch::forward`, which finds the still-running predecessor and exits — so a naive
//! spawn-then-exit produces no window at all. The parent sets [`ENV`] on the child; the child sees
//! it, skips `forward`, and waits for the predecessor's endpoint to go quiet instead.
//!
//! **[`ENV`] is read and removed on the first line.** Left in the environment it is inherited by
//! every terminal tab, every dump tool, and by the *next* relaunch's child — which would then skip
//! `forward` for ever. Taken the way `launch::Opening` takes the handoff credential, and for the
//! same reason.
