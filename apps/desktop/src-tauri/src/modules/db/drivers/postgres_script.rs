//! Running whatever SQL the user typed, against PostgreSQL — the counterpart of `mysql_script.rs`,
//! and the same three jobs: split a script, run it statement by statement, and answer what the
//! server makes of one statement without running it.
//!
//! Three things differ from MySQL, and each is the reason for a piece of code below:
//!
//! * **Dollar quoting.** `$$ ... $$` and `$tag$ ... $tag$` hold text that may contain anything,
//!   semicolons included, and a function body is normally written that way — so a splitter that
//!   does not know about it carves every `CREATE FUNCTION` into pieces.
//! * **No `USE`.** The database is decided by which pool this is handed, not by a statement at the
//!   top of the script — see `postgres::Pools`.
//! * **Parse rather than PREPARE.** Checking a statement without running it is a protocol message
//!   here, not a SQL statement, so the user's text is never interpolated into SQL to check it.
