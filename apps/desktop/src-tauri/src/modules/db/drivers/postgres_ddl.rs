//! Changing the shape of a PostgreSQL database: its tables, their columns and their indexes.
//!
//! The specs come in as `mysql_structure.rs`'s do, because one set of dialogs fills either. What
//! differs is everything about how they are carried out, and three differences shape this module:
//!
//! * **A column is changed one property at a time.** MySQL's `CHANGE COLUMN` restates a column
//!   whole; PostgreSQL has no such statement, so [`modify_column`] reads what the column is now,
//!   compares it with what is being asked for, and emits a clause per difference. That is also what
//!   keeps it from rewriting a large table to set a type the column already has.
//! * **A comment is its own statement.** `COMMENT ON` rather than a clause inside the definition,
//!   so almost everything here runs as several statements — inside a transaction, which PostgreSQL
//!   unlike MySQL will roll DDL back out of.
//! * **An index is not part of its table.** `CREATE INDEX` stands alone and the index lives in a
//!   schema of its own accord, so it is named and dropped separately from the table it covers.
