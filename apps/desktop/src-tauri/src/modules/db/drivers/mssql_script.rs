//! Running whatever T-SQL the user typed in the Query tab. The counterpart of `mysql_script.rs`/
//! `postgres_script.rs`, and the same three jobs — split a script, run it statement by statement,
//! and answer what the server makes of one statement without running it — plus a fourth SQL Server
//! alone needs: carving `GO` batches out before any of that starts (D9).
//!
//! Kept in step with `src/modules/db/sql/syntax.ts`'s `MSSQL_SYNTAX` and
//! `src/modules/db/sql/statements.ts`'s `splitStatements` by a parallel test suite below — same
//! input, same statement count — not by a shared shape: Rust has no `SqlSyntax`, and the frontend
//! splitter runs before any command reaches this file at all (Plan 4).
//!
//! **`tiberius` has no call that returns both rows and a rows-affected count, unlike `sqlx`.**
//! `Client::query`/`simple_query` return a `QueryStream` whose `into_results()` only collects `Row`
//! and result-set `Metadata` tokens — a plain `UPDATE` with no result set comes back as an empty
//! `Vec<Vec<Row>>`, its `Done` token silently dropped. `Client::execute` reads the opposite way: it
//! collects only `Done`/`DoneProc`/`DoneInProc` tokens into an `ExecuteResult`, discarding any row
//! data those same tokens might have accompanied. `sqlx::raw_sql(...).fetch_many()`, which
//! `mysql_script`/`postgres_script` use for both at once via `Either<QueryResult, Row>`, has no
//! `tiberius` equivalent — confirmed by reading `tiberius-0.12.3`'s `result.rs`/`client.rs`, not
//! assumed.
//!
//! Worse, `execute`/`query` are not a free choice between the two even taken separately: both send
//! their SQL through `sp_executesql` (`RpcProcId::ExecuteSQL`), and SQL Server gives an
//! `sp_executesql` call its own scope — a local temp table (`#t`) created inside one is dropped the
//! instant that call returns, invisible to the very next statement even on the same `Connection`.
//! Found live against the test server, not from source alone: a `CREATE TABLE #t` sent through
//! `execute`, followed by an `INSERT INTO #t` through another `execute` call on the same session,
//! failed with "Invalid object name '#t'". So [`run_statement`] never uses `execute`/`query` at
//! all — everything goes through `simple_query`, a plain TDS batch with no scope of its own, and the
//! row count `simple_query` cannot give directly is read back with an appended `SELECT @@ROWCOUNT`
//! in the same batch instead. See [`run_statement`] for the detail.

/// cannot even kill its own session. The test server only has `sa`, which always has it, so this
/// cannot be measured against an ordinary login (D8 leaves this open rather than resolved against a
/// login that always passes). Rather than gate the Cancel button on an untested permission probe, it
/// stays open and any permission error SQL Server gives comes back to the user exactly as the server
/// worded it — extending `mysql_cancel_query`'s "asking to cancel what already finished is not an
/// error" with "asking to cancel what you may not kill is the server's answer to give, not this
/// app's to guess at".
