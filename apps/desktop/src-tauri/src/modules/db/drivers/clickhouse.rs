//! ClickHouse, read side: connecting over its HTTP interface and reading what is on it.
//!
//! No sqlx driver exists for ClickHouse, so this module talks the HTTP interface directly through
//! `reqwest` — already in the tree for the REST module — rather than adding a client crate built
//! around rows of a fixed, compile-time shape. `clickhouse` (the crate ClickHouse Inc. publishes)
//! is exactly that: it wants a Rust struct per table, which is the wrong shape for a browser that
//! opens a table it has never seen before. Every query here is sent as the request body with
//! `FORMAT JSON` appended; the response carries its own column names and types in `meta` and the
//! rows as JSON objects in `data`, which is already the shape `row_to_json` builds by hand for
//! MySQL and PostgreSQL.
//!
//! v1 was read-only throughout — see the plan this was built from
//! (`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-04-clickhouse-db-kind.md`). Row writes (insert/update/delete)
//! shipped after it — see `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-04-clickhouse-row-writes-design.md`. DDL,
//! dump/restore and the Query tab's own writes are still closed.
