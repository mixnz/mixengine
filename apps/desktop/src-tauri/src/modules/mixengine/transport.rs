//!
//! `mixengine_platform::ipc::Connection` does the whole of it: on Windows it waits out a pipe
//! that is between instances and refuses one another account holds *before* a byte is written; on
//! Unix it opens the socket file under `run/`. What used to be here — a named-pipe dial, a retry
//! loop, an owner check read through `windows-sys` — was that crate's code kept in step by hand
//! (phase 11, T102).
