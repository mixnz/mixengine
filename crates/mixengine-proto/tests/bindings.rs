//! The published TypeScript contract and the crate it is generated from cannot drift apart.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T56**. `packaging/bindings.sh --check` regenerates the contract and compares the
//! bytes, which answers *"does the file say what the type says"*. This answers the questions that
//! survive a correct regeneration: is every public type in it, does any two of them collide, and is
//! everything left out of it left out on purpose.
//!
//! It is the shape `crates/mixengine-core/tests/packaging.rs` uses on `MIX_BINARIES`, for the same
//! reason: a list nothing forces to agree with the code is a list that will not.
//!
//! **No feature and no `ts-rs`.** These read the committed tree and this crate's own source, so
//! they run in the ordinary `test` job on all three operating systems rather than only in the one
//! that regenerates.
