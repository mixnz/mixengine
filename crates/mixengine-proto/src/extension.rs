//! What an `extension.toml` says about itself, as every client renders it — roadmap task **T80**.
//!
//! **Not to be confused with [`crate::runtime_api`]'s `Extension*` types**, which are about a *PHP*
//! extension being switched on for one installed runtime. These are MixEngine's own extensions:
//! Mailpit, phpMyAdmin, Adminer. The two vocabularies never meet, and the older one keeps its names
//! because renaming four public types serves nothing this task is for (the T80 design, D11).
//!
//! The manifest itself lives in `mixengine-core::extensions::manifest`, for T77's reason: what
//! travels on the wire is the *answer*, and what parses a file belongs beside the file.
//!
//! **None of these enums is `#[non_exhaustive]`, deliberately.** Every other enum in this crate is,
//! because the supervisor's vocabulary grows with the phases; these four are the whole of what
//! `schema = 1` means, so a fifth [`ExtensionKind`] is a *format* change. Making one is meant to
//! break every place that decides something from a kind — [`ExtensionKind`] chooses which tables a
//! manifest may carry, and a `_` arm there is where a new kind would slip through with no table
//! rule of its own.
