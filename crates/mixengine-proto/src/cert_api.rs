//! What `cert.ca_status` answers: this home's certificate authority, and nothing about the machine.
//!
//! **There is no trust-store field, and that is a decision rather than an omission.** Whether an
//! operating system trusts this certificate is a question about the operating system, answered by
//! machinery roadmap task T49 builds; a field this build could only ever fill with "unknown" would
//! be an answer nobody can act on. [`DnsStatus`](crate::DnsStatus) took the same shape for the same
//! reason (T46): report the independent facts, and refuse to collapse them into a verdict.
//!
//! **And there is nowhere here a private key could travel.**
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md` says the key is never copied, exported by an RPC, or
//! sent to a client, and the way that stays true is that no type below has a field to put one in.
