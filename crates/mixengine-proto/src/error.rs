//! Each crate below the daemon keeps its own `thiserror` enum, shaped for the code that raises it.
//! Exactly one of them crosses the wire, and this is it: a machine-readable [`ErrorCode`], a
//! message written for a person, and an optional hint naming the way out. The division of labour is
//! the whole design — **programs branch on the code, people read the message**. That is why the
//! code set is closed and the message is not: a message may be reworded in any release, and nothing
//! downstream is allowed to parse it.
