//! The daemon batches everything that needs an administrative token and spends **one** prompt on the
//! whole of it — `docs/decisions/0005-on-demand-elevation.md` calls elevating inside a loop a
//! defect. What is here is the vocabulary that makes the waiting visible: what is in the queue, what
//! each operation will change, whether this machine can raise a prompt at all, and what the last
//! grant did.
//!
//! **Nothing here decides anything.** A declined prompt is a normal outcome, so a client renders a
//! pending list rather than an error, and the daemon is what knows the list is not empty.
