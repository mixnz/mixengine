//! `daemon.bundle`'s types — the wire answer and the archive's own schema. Roadmap task **T93**.
//!
//! **The archive's schema lives here and not in the daemon**, although [`Manifest`] and
//! [`PlatformFacts`] never travel on the wire. A bundle is read by whoever was sent one, which is
//! rarely the machine that produced it and need not be a MixEngine build at all; putting the shape
//! in the crate every client already links is what lets a client open one without a daemon.
//!
//! **What is *not* here is a redaction pass.**
//! `docs/decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md` keeps a credential out of the
//! spec, the database and the log at the type level, and names this bundle while doing so. A filter
//! layered on top would be a guess that a pattern matched — and worse than nothing, because it would
//! invite the next reader to believe the log is filtered rather than clean.
//!
//! What this module owes instead is [`Part`]: a closed list, so that nothing arrives in an archive
//! because a directory happened to hold it.
