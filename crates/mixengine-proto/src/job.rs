//! Long operations that outlive the call that asked for them.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` states the rule this module exists to serve: *long
//! operations return a job*, because a download of eighty megabytes cannot be an RPC call a client
//! waits inside. What comes back from `runtime.install` is a [`JobId`]; what happens afterwards
//! arrives as [`crate::DaemonEvent::JobProgress`] and [`crate::DaemonEvent::JobFinished`], and
//! `job.wait` is there for a script that has nothing to do but wait.
//!
//! Three types and the split is the one [`crate::state`] draws for services: [`JobState`] is where a
//! job is, [`JobOutcome`] is what it ended up producing, and [`JobUpdate`] is a move travelling as
//! one value — persisted by `mixengine-core` and published by the daemon from that same value, so
//! the `jobs` row and the event cannot disagree about what happened.
//!
//! **What is deliberately absent is a list of job kinds.** [`JobKind`] is a validated string and not
//! an enum, for the reason `packages.name` is not `CHECK`ed in the first migration: the set grows
//! with every phase that has something long to do — and, from T80, with every extension that ships
//! one — so a closed vocabulary here would be a schema change per feature and a wire break per
//! extension. What keeps it honest instead is that a kind *is* the method that produced it.
