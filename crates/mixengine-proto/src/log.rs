//!
//! Here rather than in `mixengine-supervisor`, for the reason
//! `docs/decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md` gives for `ServiceSpec`: proto
//! owns the vocabulary, and a line that is captured, kept in a ring, written to a file and served on
//! `GET /logs/{id}` is one value rather than four descriptions of one. T14 set the same precedent
//! for [`ServiceTransition`](crate::ServiceTransition) — the row that is persisted and the event
//! that is emitted are the same value, so an event describing something that did not happen cannot
//! be built.
//!
//! What is *not* here is the service the line came from. A capture belongs to one service, and
//! repeating its id on every line would spend a field per line on an answer the caller already had;
//! the id is in the path of the endpoint that served it.
//!
//! **A line is never a `DaemonEvent`** —
//! `docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md`. What a client reads is a
//! [`LogFrame`], on a connection it opened for one service.
