//! The vocabulary a runtime is described in: which language it is, or which tool is managed like one.
//!
//! The same split [`crate::job`] draws over [`crate::job_api`] — this module is what a runtime *is*,
//! and the shapes a client asks and renders with are next door in [`crate::runtime_api`].
//!
//! **[`RuntimeKind`] is closed**, and the decision is not cosmetic: the set of languages MixEngine
//! manages is a product decision with a `CHECK` behind it in the schema, never something a package
//! index gets to extend by publishing.
//!
//! A version and a channel used to live here too. They moved to [`crate::version`] in T31a, when a
//! service package turned out to need the same string with the same rules — they were never about
//! runtimes, only ever used by them first.
