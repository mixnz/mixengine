//! Where a home's four growing directories are, and whether that can still change — roadmap task
//! **T145**.
//!
//! **Not an RPC, and the types are here anyway.** Everything this describes is decided *before* a
//! daemon is listening: a window drawing its "choose a disk" screen has nothing to call, because the
//! thing it is asking about is where the daemon it has not started yet will put its files. So the
//! answer arrives from `mixengined --storage`, a one-shot that prints this and exits.
//!
//! It lives in `mixengine-proto` for the reason every other shape does: the window is typed against
//! `bindings/`, and a JSON document a client parsed by hand would be a second definition of the same
//! thing. `apps/desktop/src-tauri` may depend on this crate and on nothing else in the workspace.
