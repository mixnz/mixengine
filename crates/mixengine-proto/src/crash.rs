//! What `mixengined` leaves behind when it hits a bug in itself. Roadmap task **T91**.
//!
//! **Every field here is one of three things**: a compile-time constant of the build that wrote it
//! (the location, the version, the target), a literal from `std` or `tokio` (the thread name), or a
//! symbol name out of a backtrace. None of them can hold a value from the home it was written in —
//! not a project's directory, not a site's name, not a password. That is what lets one of these be
//! attached to a public bug report without being read first.
//!
//! **The panic message is deliberately not here.** It is `format!`-ed from whatever was in scope at
//! the moment of a bug, which is the one string in this product nobody reviewed: an `unwrap()` on
//! `mixengine_core::Error::Io` renders the path that error carries. It goes to `daemon.log`
//! instead, where it is on the user's own machine and beside the paths that log has always carried.
//!
//! **Not a redaction pass**, for the reason [`bundle_api`](crate::Part)'s own header gives about
//! one: a filter is a guess that a pattern matched, and it invites the next reader to believe a
//! file is filtered rather than clean. What this module owes instead is the field list below —
//! short enough to read in one screen, which is where the guarantee actually lives.
//!
//! Decided in
//! [ADR 0022](../../../docs/decisions/0022-a-crash-report-is-recorded-by-default-and-sent-by-nothing.md).
