//! What `update.*` answers — roadmap task **T88**.
//!
//! **The daemon decides and the client renders.** Whether a release is offered is
//! [`UpdateStatus::offered`] and *why not* is [`UpdateStatus::because`], as a whole sentence: the
//! four reasons a perfectly good release is not shown — it is not newer, there is no build for this
//! machine, somebody skipped it, somebody asked to be reminded later — would otherwise be four codes
//! that every client had to spell back out in English, which is the business-logic-in-a-client bug
//! `CLAUDE.md` forbids.
//!
//! **Nothing here names the elevated helper's update path.** `mixengine-elevate` is excluded from
//! the swap by name and reported in [`UpdateApplied::kept`]; replacing it needs its own elevation
//! prompt with a minisign check inside the elevated context, which is roadmap task **T88a**.
