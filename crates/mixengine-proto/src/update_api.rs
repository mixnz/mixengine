//! four reasons a perfectly good release is not shown — it is not newer, there is no build for this
//! machine, somebody skipped it, somebody asked to be reminded later — would otherwise be four codes
//! that every client had to spell back out in English, which is the business-logic-in-a-client bug
//! `CLAUDE.md` forbids.
