//! What `daemon.disk_usage` and `daemon.cleanup` answer — roadmap task **T96**.
//!
//! **Five categories, and four different answers about them.** The screen this exists for asks for
//! runtimes, data, logs and certs; `cache/` is the fifth and it is the only one anybody actually
//! wants back, so a chart drawn from the four would be a chart with nothing to do underneath it.
//! What each row then answers is *whether it can be reclaimed and by what* — and that is the API's
//! to state rather than a client's to derive, which is the policy `CLAUDE.md` keeps out of clients.
//!
//! **The five do not sum to the home, and [`DiskUsage::other_bytes`] is why they do not have to.**
//! `bin/`, `etc/`, `packages/`, `extensions/`, `blueprints/`, `run/` and the database are none of
//! them; a report that stopped at five would be one from which a client draws a pie chart missing
//! its largest slice.
//!
//! **A plan and an act, on `daemon.uninstall_plan`/`daemon.uninstall`'s split (T87)** — a call that
//! measured and deleted in one breath would leave no moment in which somebody could be shown what is
//! about to go. [`Reclaim::ByCleanup`] *is* the plan: it is what the act would take, counted before
//! it goes.
