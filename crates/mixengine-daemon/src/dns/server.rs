//! The sockets, and the task that answers on them — roadmap task **T44**.
//!
//! Everything about *what* to answer is [`super::answer`]'s, and everything here is about getting
//! bytes to it and back: two sockets on loopback, hickory's UDP and TCP framing, and a task that
//! ends with the daemon's root cancellation token.
//!
//! **Loopback and nothing else** — the T44 design, D8. Binding `127.0.0.1` rather than the wildcard
//! address is the whole of this server's access control: a query from off the machine cannot
//! arrive, so there is no source address to check and — with no forwarder behind it — nothing to
//! abuse if one did.
//!
//! **Both transports, always.** A DNS client that receives a truncated answer retries over TCP, and
//! a server that registered only a UDP socket fails that retry by refusing the connection, which
//! reads as a network problem rather than as a missing listener. They are bound as a pair or not at
//! all.
