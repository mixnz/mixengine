//! The built-in DNS server, and which of this home's two name mechanisms is running — roadmap task
//! **T44**, which also closes **T46a**.
//!
//! `site.create` must prompt for nothing. Writing a hosts entry per domain costs an elevation
//! prompt per site, which is the repeated cost [ADR
//! 0005](../../../../docs/decisions/0005-on-demand-elevation.md) says this product may not pay;
//! a server that answers `*.test` by pattern pays it once, at first-run setup, and never again
//! however many sites there are.
//!
//! Three modules: [`answer`] is the policy as a pure function, [`server`] is the two sockets and
//! the task on them, and this one is the mode — which mechanism this home is actually running on,
//! and why.
//!
//! # The mode has two terms, and both of them are now real
//!
//! The T44 design, D4. "Running on DNS" is not "the server is listening". It is "the server is
//! listening **and** something is routing a managed TLD to it" — and T44 could only ever produce
//! the first, so it hard-coded the second to "not wired" and every home stayed on its hosts file.
//!
//! **T45 is the producer of the second term**, through
//! [`ResolverConfig`](mixengine_platform::ResolverConfig): the machine is asked, on every start,
//! which of the managed TLDs it already sends here. So the branch T44 wrote and could only reach
//! from a test is the branch this build first runs for real.
//!
//! # And it is per TLD, not per home
//!
//! The T45 design, D6. Every mechanism measured scopes to **one TLD**, and `.local` is never wired
//! at all — so [`Dns::wired`] is a list rather than a flag, and a home can answer `*.blog.test` by
//! pattern while still needing a hosts line for `shop.local`. [`DnsMode`] survives as the one-word
//! summary a person reads; it is no longer what the hosts block is computed from.
