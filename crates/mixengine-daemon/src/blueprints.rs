//! `blueprint.*`: what a project is made of, written down and read back.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T77**. [`crate::projects`]' shape one namespace across, and like it there is no
//! index, no fetcher and no job here — a capture is rows and one rendered file inside this home.
//!
//! # Applying happens elsewhere
//!
//! What is here is the *planning*: [`Blueprints::planned`] is the one path a dry run and a real
//! apply both take. Carrying the plan out is [`crate::api::apply`], because every action in a plan
//! is a capability `Api` holds and this type holds none of them (the T78 design, D1). The one thing
//! read back from there is the `PATH` a scaffold command would run with, so that the plan judges the
//! command's program against the same string (T78b, D3).
