//! `daemon.uninstall_plan` and `daemon.uninstall` — roadmap task **T87**.
//!
//! **Two methods on `daemon.doctor`/`daemon.doctor_repair`'s split, and not one flag.** The plan is
//! a read in the strict sense — no row written, nothing enqueued, no prompt possible — which is what
//! makes it safe to put in front of the one command that cannot be undone. The act is a job, because
//! it can raise the elevation prompt and what that waits on is a person reading a dialog.
//!
//! Both build their list from [`inventory::take`], which is the one enumeration: two of them, one
//! for the dry run and one for the real run, is the second inventory the roadmap sentence refuses.
