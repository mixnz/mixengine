//! The queue of privileged operations this daemon is holding, and the only thing that raises a
//! prompt. Roadmap task **T40b**.
//!
//! **The division is the one [`crate::jobs`] documents, one table across.**
//! [`mixengine_core::elevation`] owns the row, the document and the report and has no loop, no clock
//! and no task; what owns the timing, the cancellation the grant hangs off and the `Events` the
//! batch is announced on is here.
//!
//! **This daemon never raises a prompt on its own initiative.**
//! `.claude/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` already carries the rule: *a method that writes outside
//! `MIXENGINE_HOME` is never called on the daemon's own initiative* (T26). Everything the helper
//! will ever do — the hosts file, the trust store, the resolver, a firewall rule — is outside the
//! home by definition; that is why it needs root. So enqueuing and flushing have two different
//! triggers: producers enqueue, and only a client calls `elevation.grant`. A fresh install where
//! nobody ever does is a machine in degraded mode forever, and that is the correct behaviour.
//!
//! **T41's `HostsApply` is the first producer.** [`Elevation::enqueue`] ships with none, which is the
//! deliberate position rather than an oversight — the same one T22 took with the job registry and
//! T19 with the service runner: the alternative is writing the queue twice, once inside the first
//! producer and once properly afterwards.
