//! Checking whether a newer MixEngine exists, and putting one on this machine — roadmap task
//! **T88**.
//!
//! # The whole sequence happens here, and `mix` prompts and reconnects
//!
//! `mixengine-cli` may depend on `mixengine-platform` and `mixengine-proto` and on nothing else —
//! `workspace_layering.rs` enforces it — and verifying a signature, unpacking an archive and
//! swapping files are all `mixengine-core`'s. So the client's whole part in an update is asking,
//! waiting for the endpoint to go quiet, and starting the new daemon, which is `Autostart::run` and
//! has been there since T9.
//!
//! # Silent on failure, and that is a requirement rather than a shrug
//!
//! `.claude/features/updates.md`: *an offline machine must never see an error, and never a slower
//! startup*. Both background callers here — the check at start and the 24 h clock — log at `debug!`
//! and change nothing when the network is not there, and `mixengine_core::index::Client` keeps the
//! last document it verified rather than losing it. What a person who *asked* gets is different:
//! `mix self-update` reports the transport failure, because they are standing there.
//!
//! # What this module deliberately cannot do
//!
//! Elevate. Nothing here has an elevation path and nothing here ever will: an updater that could ask
//! for root would be the local privilege-escalation vector `.claude/features/updates.md` calls the
//! single most important rule on the page. A copy of MixEngine installed where this account cannot
//! write is refused in words, before a byte is downloaded — `mixengine_core::updates::placement`.
