//! Whether this machine starts a daemon for this home at login — the only door onto it. Roadmap
//! task **T85b**.
//!
//! **Written only when somebody asks**, which is [`crate::shims`]' rule and the same one: a logon
//! task, a LaunchAgent and a systemd user unit are all outside `MIXENGINE_HOME`, and
//! `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` has no method that writes there on the daemon's own
//! initiative. `path.*` is the first of them and `autostart.*` is the second. So nothing here is
//! called at start-up, and this type holds no state of its own to refresh.
//!
//! **`enable` registers and does not start; `disable` removes and does not stop.** There is a daemon
//! running by the time either can be called — it is the one answering the call — and a person who
//! turned off "start at login" must not lose it.
//!
//! **`for_this_home` is composed here and not by a client.** There is one entry per user, so a
//! second home enabling replaces it; a client folding "is this entry mine" for itself would be
//! business logic in a client and a place for two clients to disagree.
