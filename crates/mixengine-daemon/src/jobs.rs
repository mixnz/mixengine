//! The jobs this daemon is running, and the only thing that starts, watches or cancels one.
//!
//! **The division is T19's, one table across.** `mixengine_core::jobs` owns the row and the state
//! machine and has no loop, no clock and no task; what owns the timing, the [`CancellationToken`]
//! each job hangs off and the `Events` every move is announced on is the daemon — so it is here,
//! for the same reason the service runner is and not in `mixengine-supervisor`.
//!
//! **`runtime.install` is the first and, in this build, only producer** — see [`crate::runtimes`].
//! T22 shipped this registry with none at all, which was the deliberate position rather than an
//! oversight: T19 built the service runner before anything could declare a service, for the same
//! reason, and the alternative is writing the loop twice — once inside the first producer and once
//! properly afterwards. What T21 left behind for this is [`mixengine_core::install::Watcher`],
//! shaped after [`JobHandle`] rather than invented separately, so that wiring the two together is
//! the `impl` at the bottom of this file and not an adapter.
//!
//! **A job's work is a task, so it does not survive this process**, which is the whole difference
//! between recovery here and the adoption in [`crate::services`]: there is nothing to adopt.
//! `mixengine_core::jobs::abandon` reconciles what a stopped daemon left behind, before the first
//! client is served.
