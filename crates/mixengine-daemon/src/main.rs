/// write-ahead log, which is what leaves one database file behind instead of one with a `-wal`
/// sidecar holding the newest commits. A budget that spent the whole ceiling on services would be
/// terminated in the middle of exactly that.
///
/// **Summed from its parts rather than chosen, because as one number it left no margin at all.** It
/// was two and a half seconds against a two-second client grace, so the checkpoint had five hundred
/// milliseconds and the whole came to the ceiling exactly: 2.5 s of services, 2 s of clients and
/// 0.5 s of checkpoint is 5 s of 5, with nothing left for a task scheduled late or a machine under
/// load — and `windows/signal.rs` says the ceiling itself may be *shorter* than five where
/// `WaitToKillTimeout` or `HungAppTimeout` were configured. So what it keeps back is now stated as
/// the three things that happen after the last service stops:
///
/// - [`SIGNAL_CLIENT_GRACE`], half a second for the connections still open,
/// - [`CHECKPOINT_MARGIN`], a second for `Store::close` and the write-ahead log,
/// - [`SCHEDULING_SLACK`], a second that is left over on purpose.

/// 2.5 + 0.5 + 1 = 4 s of the 5 s the OS allows, one second of it slack. **The margin is bought from
/// the clients rather than from the services**, which is the choice worth naming: shortening the
/// client grace on the signal path costs a client that is between requests nothing, where raising
/// this constant instead would have taken the same second out of MariaDB's flush.
