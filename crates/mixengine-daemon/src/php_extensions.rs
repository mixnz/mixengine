//! `runtime.list_extensions` and `runtime.set_extension` — roadmap task **T28**.
//!
//! **These are PHP extensions.** MixEngine's own — Mailpit, phpMyAdmin, Adminer — are
//! [`crate::extensions`]. This file was called `extensions.rs` until T80 needed that name for
//! the thing the product calls an extension, and two modules cannot share one.
//!
//! Its own module rather than two more methods on [`crate::runtimes`] because of what it needs: a
//! toggle rewrites a file a *service* is reading, so this is the one runtime operation that has to
//! reach the registry. `runtimes.rs` is the index, the download and the row, and it holds none.
//!
//! # What a change answers about the pool
//!
//! **The daemon does not restart a pool nobody asked it to restart**; it reports. That is T32's own
//! policy for a changed override:
//!
//! | | Unix | Windows |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | mechanism | `SIGUSR2`, which the pool's spec already carries | none — `php-cgi.exe` reads its ini at startup |
//! | answer | `Reloaded` | `RestartRequired` |
//!
//! A pool that is not running at all is `PoolNotRunning`, which is neither a failure nor a reload: it
//! reads the new set when it is started. The two are told apart by the *spec* and not by a `cfg` —
//! a pool whose recipe gave it no `ReloadBehaviour` is one nothing can hand a configuration to,
//! which is Windows today and is any future recipe that says the same.
