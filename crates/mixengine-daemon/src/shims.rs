//! `<root>/bin` and this user's PATH — the only door into either. Roadmap task **T26**.
//!
//! Two mechanisms with one purpose, which is why they are one type: filling the directory makes
//! `php` a file, putting the directory on the PATH makes `php` a word somebody can type, and either
//! on its own does nothing a person would notice. `path.install` does both and `path.status`
//! reports both.
//!
//! **The two halves have opposite policies about being done without being asked**, and the split is
//! where the change lands.
//!
//! `<root>/bin` is inside the home, so it is refreshed on **every start**, beside the recovery
//! passes that reconcile services and jobs: it is a projection of a table in this binary, exactly as
//! `etc/` is a projection of the database, and a home whose `bin/` was deleted is repaired by
//! starting the daemon. Nothing outside the root is touched by it and there is nothing for a user to
//! consent to.
//!
//! The PATH is **only ever changed when somebody asks**. It is a file in the user's home on Unix and
//! a value in their registry hive on Windows — outside the root, and outside what
//! `.claude/architecture/overview.md` lists as MixEngine's to write on its own account. A daemon
//! that edited `~/.zprofile` because it happened to start at login would be a program that changed
//! the shell of somebody who had only installed it.
