//! Where a [`ServiceSpec`](mixengine_proto::ServiceSpec) comes from — the port, and the thing that
//! answers it.
//!
//! **T19 wrote the question and T30 wrote the answer.** A `services` row carries `package_id`,
//! `port`, `data_dir`, `config_overrides_json` and `limits_json`, which is the *input* to config
//! generation rather than a spec; what turns it into one is
//! [`mixengine_core::generate::Generator`], which renders the service's configuration into
//! `etc/<service-id>/` and builds the specification that points at it. The registry still depends on
//! the question rather than on the answer — [`SpecSource`] here, a fixture in the tests, the
//! generator in a running daemon — because the fixture is what lets the registry's own tests declare
//! a service without a database row, a recipe or a file on disk.
//!
//! The alternative that was not taken is a `spec_json` column, which would duplicate three columns
//! the row already has and keep a second copy of what generation renders — `CLAUDE.md`'s
//! disposable-generated-config rule read backwards. See
//! `.claude/roadmap/phase-1-process-supervision.md`.
