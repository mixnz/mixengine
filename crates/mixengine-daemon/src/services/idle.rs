//! Deciding that a service has nothing to do — roadmap task **T69**.
//!
//! The reading is [`mixengine_supervisor::idle`]'s, on the reasoning written there. What is here is
//! everything the supervisor cannot know: how long this home's owner said to wait, what depends on
//! the service, and whether somebody asked for it to stay warm.
//!
//! # The arithmetic is in observations, never in elapsed time
//!
//! A policy's `after` is spent as *that many consecutive sweeps that saw the service idle*, and the
//! count lives in this struct rather than in a column. The alternative — an `idle_since` timestamp
//! compared against the clock — fails on the one case that matters most: tokio measures from
//! `std::time::Instant`, which counts no time on Linux or macOS while the machine is suspended, so
//! the first tick after a laptop's lid opens can arrive eight hours late. A timestamp comparison
//! concludes the service was idle for eight hours and kills it in the first second of somebody's
//! morning. Counting sweeps concludes it has one observation, which is the truth: nothing was
//! measured while the machine was asleep.
//!
//! A daemon restart therefore forgets, which is also correct — a service just adopted has been
//! observed zero times.
//!
//! # Three refusals before anything is measured
//!
//! A service with no policy, a service that is not running, and a service something exempts are all
//! settled before a probe is taken, because each is cheaper than the reading and none of them can be
//! overruled by one.
