//! What a client reads on `GET /logs/{id}`: one service's output, from before it connected and from
//! after.
//!
//! **This is not a second capture.** `mixengine-supervisor` reads the pipes, splits the lines,
//! writes `current.log` and keeps the ring a crash-loop cutoff quotes; all of that belongs to *one
//! run* of the process and is dropped with it. What lives here is the half a client needs and that
//! one cannot give: a place to read from that outlives any single run, so a `mix service logs -f`
//! left open across a crash, a backoff and a restart keeps printing rather than ending three times.
//!
//! **Why the daemon holds a ring of its own.** A subscription is only ever "from now on", and a log
//! panel that opened with nothing would be useless — the lines somebody wants are the ones printed
//! *before* they looked. Handing over that tail and the subscription in the same breath is what makes
//! the seam impossible: [`ServiceLog::read`] takes both under one lock, so no line can arrive between
//! the two and be lost, and none can be delivered twice. That is the whole reason this ring is not
//! the supervisor's — a snapshot taken there and a subscription taken here could not be made one
//! decision across two crates.
//!
//! **The file answers only when this daemon has nothing of its own.** `current.log` is plain text
//! and carries no timestamp and no stream tag — deliberately, so that whoever reads MariaDB's log
//! reads this one with the same tools — so lines recovered from it are
//! [`LogFrame::Historic`] and say plainly that only their text
//! survived. It is read when the ring is empty and never mixed with it: a daemon that has been up
//! since the service started has the better answer already, and stitching the two would mean
//! guessing where one ends in a file something else is still appending to.
//!
//! See `docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md` for why none of this is an event.
