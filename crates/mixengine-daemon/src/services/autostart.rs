//! What starts when the daemon does — roadmap task **T113**.
//!
//! **A plan, not a loop over flagged rows.** A php-fpm pool that is set and depends on a MariaDB
//! that is not must bring MariaDB up, because a pool whose database is missing is a pool that fails
//! its health check. So the flagged ids are the *roots* of a
//! [`ServiceGraph::start_plan`](mixengine_core::services::graph::ServiceGraph::start_plan) and never
//! the walk itself, and a service with the setting off can be started here by something that depends
//! on it — the same rule `mix service start php-fpm@8.3` already follows, and the reason
//! `mix service autostart` says so in its own help.
//!
//! **Spawned after the endpoint is serving**, which is the one thing separating this from the four
//! loops it sits beside in `serve`. Those are sweeps whose first pass must not race a client; this
//! one starts real programs and takes seconds, and a daemon that will not answer `daemon.status`
//! until MariaDB's first run has finished looks hung at exactly the moment somebody is looking at
//! it. Every state it reaches is announced on the event stream a client is already reading, so a
//! dashboard fills in as it goes rather than appearing complete.
//!
//! **And after recovery**, on `Registry::recover`'s own reasoning: a reading must never be taken of
//! a service this daemon has not decided about yet. A service recovery adopted is already up, and
//! `Registry::start` counts one that is up as reached rather than restarting it — so an adopted
//! service is not disturbed by having been flagged.
//!
//! **One attempt, and the failure is a state.** The two reasons a boot start fails are a port
//! somebody else holds and a program that is not there any more, and neither is fixed by trying
//! again thirty seconds later. Both are already reported — [`StateReason::PortInUse`] names the
//! process holding the port — and both are already on the row a client lists. There is no retry, no
//! backoff and no second pass here; what puts a *crashed* service back is the restart policy, which
//! is a different question and already has an answer.
//!
//! **It is not the idle sweeper's opposite.** A service that is set here and also has an idle
//! timeout starts at boot and is stopped again when nothing uses it, and that is two settings
//! answering different questions rather than one overruling the other — see the design's D5. Nothing
//! in this file exempts anything from anything.
