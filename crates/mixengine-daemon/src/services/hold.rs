//! Holding a database's own address while nothing is serving it — roadmap task **T70a**.
//!
//! T70's activator holds an address of its *own*, permanently, and a site file names it as a
//! fallback for the pool it belongs to. There is no front end in front of a database to name one
//! in — a client dials `127.0.0.1:3306` and nothing else will do — so here the daemon binds what
//! the service itself listens on, and gives it back when the service starts.
//!
//! # The window, stated rather than hidden
//!
//! Between the release and the server's own bind, nothing holds the address, and a connection
//! arriving in that interval is refused by the kernel. The interval is the service's start time.
//!
//! **The first client is always served**, because its connection is already accepted when the
//! release happens — it waits on the splice, not on the address. Only a *second* client, arriving
//! while the first one's start is still running, meets the window.
//!
//! That cost is accepted because the alternatives are worse, which is the design's D4 and not this
//! module's argument: always proxying would put every query's bytes through the daemon for the
//! connection's whole life and would make a *running* database unreachable when the daemon dies,
//! and not activating databases at all leaves M7 unreachable. `resource-isolation.md` says the same
//! thing where a user reads it.
//!
//! # D8 needs nothing here
//!
//! A service a person stopped is never held for — [`hold_if_wakeable`] binds on an idle stop and on
//! nothing else — so there is no address at which their stop could be undone. The web path needs
//! `services.stopped_by` to answer the same question because its activator's address is bound
//! either way; this path answers it by not binding.
