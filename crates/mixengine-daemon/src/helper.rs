//! What the privileged helper installed on this machine is, and what to say when it is older than
//! the daemon reading it — roadmap task **T88a**.
//!
//! # Asked without a prompt
//!
//! `Probe` needs no administrative token — the T40 design's D5 made it so, precisely so that the
//! operation reporting whether a process is elevated could ever report `false`. So the daemon finds
//! out what the installed helper is by *running it as an ordinary process*, with a one-operation
//! batch, and reading the header every answer already carries. No prompt is spent and nothing is
//! changed.
//!
//! **Only when a helper is installed.** On a fresh machine and in every development tree there is
//! nothing to ask, `Elevation::require_helper` enqueues `HelperInstall {}` as it always has, and
//! this costs nothing at all.
//!
//! # And what it is for
//!
//! Two things, and neither is speculative. The daemon marks each request with the lower of its own
//! protocol and the helper's, because a fixed old binary cannot be taught a newer one. And it reads
//! `supported_ops` before deciding what to say about an old helper: without it, the only way to
//! discover that the installed helper predates `helper-replace` is to enqueue one, spend a prompt,
//! and be answered `Unsupported` — which deletes the row (the T40b design, D5) and leaves a person
//! with a refusal and no sentence.
