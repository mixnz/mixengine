//! `daemon.disk_usage` and `daemon.cleanup` — roadmap task **T96**.
//!
//! **A strict read and a job, on `daemon.uninstall_plan`/`daemon.uninstall`'s split (T87).** A call
//! that measured and deleted in one breath would leave no moment in which somebody could be shown
//! what is about to go.
//!
//! **The read is cached, and that is not a convenience.** The dashboard this exists for holds the
//! event stream open and re-reads whenever something changes; a walk of `runtimes/` is tens of
//! thousands of files, so an uncached reading would be a disk walk per event. The last one is kept
//! for [`FRESH_FOR`] and [`DiskUsageQuery::refresh`] forces a new one.
//!
//! **Everything that touches the disk happens on a blocking thread**, per
//! `.claude/standards/rust.md`: a `read_dir` of a cold `runtimes/` is seconds, and the daemon is
//! supervising processes while it happens.
