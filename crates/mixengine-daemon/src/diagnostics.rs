//! `daemon.bundle` — one archive a person can attach to a bug report. Roadmap task **T93**.
//!
//! **Five members, and the list is closed.** What goes in is
//! [`Part`]'s five variants and never a walk of the home: `certs/` will hold
//! the internal CA's private key, `data/` holds the user's databases, and `run/` is what stands
//! between a local process and this daemon. A sweep written today omits all three because whoever
//! wrote it remembered them; a closed list removes the remembering.
//!
//! **What was left out is named, with its reason.** A bundle silent about where it did not look is
//! a bundle claiming it looked everywhere — see [`DECIDED_AGAINST`].
//!
//! **A part that could not be read is an omission and not the end of the call.** A bundle is wanted
//! exactly when things are failing, so an archive lost because one reading failed would be an
//! archive lost at the worst possible moment. That is not the same as a part that is *empty*: a
//! daemon which has logged nothing is an answer, and a read that failed is a failure — the
//! distinction `Keyring::secret` already draws between `Ok(None)` and `Err`.
//!
//! **Everything that touches the disk happens on one blocking thread.** Reading a megabyte of log,
//! deflating five members and unlinking old archives are all blocking calls, and
//! `docs/standards/rust.md` puts anything that can hang off the runtime's threads.
