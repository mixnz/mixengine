//! Ending a share nobody ended — roadmap task **T76**.
//!
//! Two things end a share on their own: the network it was shared on stopped being the network this
//! machine is on, and a `--for` deadline passed. Both take the road T74 built —
//! [`Sites::unshare`](super::Sites::unshare) — because the order that road moves in (the firewall
//! rule, then the listener, then the certificate) is a security property, and a background caller
//! with its own spelling of it is a second place for it to be wrong.
//!
//! **What is compared is the interface and its address, and nothing else** — the T76 design, D3.
//! Two networks that hand one adapter the same address are indistinguishable to this module; that
//! is written down as a limitation of this build in `.claude/features/lan-sharing.md` rather than
//! guessed at with an SSID this workspace would have to read three different ways.
//!
//! **A finding has to survive two passes before it is acted on** — D2, and the correction this
//! module is built around. A DHCP renewal, a wake from sleep or an adapter resetting can each make
//! one enumeration report an interface with no address; revoking on that single reading unshares
//! every site on the machine and reissues every certificate. **A false revoke costs more than a
//! late one**, which is also what makes a thirty-second period affordable.
//!
//! **The debounce covers the reading and not the decision.** An expiry is computed from a row and a
//! clock, with no flaky reading anywhere in it, so it acts on the first pass: waiting for a second
//! would delay something a person deliberately asked for and protect nothing.
