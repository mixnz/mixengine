//! Running a blueprint's own command — roadmap task **T78a**.
//!
//! **This is the first thing MixEngine runs that MixEngine did not write**, and every guard around
//! it is somewhere else: the consent that names the command is checked in
//! [`super`](crate::api::apply), the trust that decides how loudly it is asked for is a column
//! decided at import, and the shell that starts it is `mixengine-platform`'s. What is here is the
//! part that is only true while it runs — where the lines go, what a cancellation does, and what the
//! exit code becomes.
//!
//! Three things it deliberately does not do:
//!
//! - **It never elevates.** The command runs under the account this daemon runs as, and nothing it
//!   does reaches the elevation queue. T78's "one prompt, at the end" is about the hosts file and
//!   the trust store; a blueprint's command is not admitted to it.
//! - **It invents no environment.** The working directory is the project's and `PATH` gains the shim
//!   directory, which is how the blueprint's own `[runtimes]` reaches the command — the shims
//!   resolve a version from the project they are run in. Nothing else is added.
//! - **It has no timeout** (the T78a design, D10). Every number that could be chosen kills a
//!   legitimate `composer install` on a slow line, and a scaffold is by definition somebody else's
//!   program doing an unknown amount of work. The bound is the job: it is visible, its output is
//!   streaming, and `job.cancel` stops it — which kills the process *group*, so the tree a package
//!   manager forked goes with it.
