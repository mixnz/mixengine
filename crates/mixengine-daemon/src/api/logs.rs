//! `GET /logs/service/{id}` and `GET /logs/job/{id}` — one subject's output, and nobody else's.
//!
//! **Two kinds of subject since roadmap task T78a**, and one difference between them: a service is
//! followed across a stop, a crash and a restart, because its output outlives any one run of the
//! process; a job has one life, so a follow on it ends when the job does rather than leaving a
//! client waiting on output that can never arrive.
//!
//! **The whole log surface, and deliberately not an event.** The event stream is a bounded broadcast
//! sized for state changes, shared by every client; a service in debug mode prints more in a second
//! than it holds, and putting output on it would cost every connected client exactly the transitions
//! it opened that stream for. See
//! `docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md`, which is also why there is no
//! `service.logs` method beside this: a JSON-RPC call cannot stream, and `?tail=N` with no `follow`
//! *is* the snapshot such a method would have been.
//!
//! **One connection, one service, and the back-pressure is per connection.** hyper polls this body
//! as fast as the client drains it, so a slow reader slows its own stream and nothing else — not
//! another client's log, and not anybody's state. A reader slow enough to fall behind the service
//! itself misses lines and is told how many, because a hole nobody mentions is worse than one that
//! is named.
//!
//! **The tail and the follow are one request.** A client that asked for the last lines and then
//! subscribed would lose whatever was printed in between, or see it twice, with no way to tell
//! which; [`ServiceLog::read`](crate::services::logs::ServiceLog::read) hands over both under one
//! lock so there is no in between. Roadmap task **T16b**.
