//! This home's certificate authority: made once, and reported on.
//!
//! **Made at start rather than when the first HTTPS site is created.**
//! `.claude/architecture/security-model.md` promises one elevation prompt at first run, covering the
//! CA, the resolver wiring and the port grant together. An authority that first appeared with the
//! first site would put its trust-store install (roadmap task T49) in a second batch and therefore
//! behind a second prompt — which is the finding T45 already made about the resolver and wrote down
//! in `main.rs` beside the block this one sits under. Generating here costs one ECDSA key on disk in
//! a home that never serves HTTPS; the alternative costs a second prompt to everybody who does.
//!
//! Everything about what an authority *is* lives in `mixengine_core::certs::ca`. This module is the
//! two things that are the daemon's: when it happens, and which thread it happens on.
