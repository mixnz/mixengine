//! A live TLS handshake against this home's own front end — roadmap task **T53**.
//!
//! **The first thing in this repository that measures a padlock rather than inferring one.** T48
//! reads an authority off disk, T50 writes a leaf and reads it back, T51 renders a `tls` line
//! naming it and T52 replaces it before it expires — every one of those is a claim about a *file*,
//! and none of them establishes that the running server presents that file to anything. The report
//! `docs/features/tls.md` calls the most common of all, a certificate a server still holds in
//! memory after the file beside it was replaced, is invisible to all of them and obvious to this.
//!
//! **Loopback, with the site's name as SNI, and never a resolved address** — the T53 design, D2.
//! Whether `blog.test` resolves is `mix doctor`'s question, and a handshake that resolved would
//! report "TLS failed" on a machine whose only fault is a resolver nobody wired.
