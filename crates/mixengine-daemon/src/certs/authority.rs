//! Replacing this home's certificate authority, and taking it back out — roadmap task **T54**.
//!
//! **The only two operations in phase 5 that take something away.** Five tasks put an authority into
//! this machine and kept the leaves under it fresh; these undo that, and the difference in risk is
//! why the two are shaped differently from each other.
//!
//! **Here rather than on [`Certificates`].** That struct holds a directory, a host and a store;
//! these need the elevation queue and the job registry as well, and a struct that grew fields for
//! them would be holding most of the daemon. `certs::renewal` set the precedent in T52: what needs
//! more than certificates takes them as arguments.
//!
//! This module is a child of `crate::certs`, which is what lets it read [`Certificates`]' own fields
//! and reuse `super::blocking` rather than adding accessors nothing else would call.
