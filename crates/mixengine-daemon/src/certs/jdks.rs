//! Every installed JDK told about this home's authority, inside its own `cacerts` — roadmap task
//! **T27e**, [ADR 0039](../../../../docs/decisions/0039-a-jdk-is-told-about-the-authority-inside-its-own-cacerts.md).
//!
//! **The browsers' shape, call for call**: a store the user owns, written without a prompt, at
//! start, on repair, on a rotation and on every removal — plus once after a JDK is installed, since
//! that is the one moment a store nobody has written to appears. Nothing here fails what called it;
//! what happened comes back in a [`JdkChange`], which the caller logs.
//!
//! A JDK reads neither the operating system's store nor the bundle `certs::bundle` writes, and no
//! environment variable *adds* an authority to the one it does read. That is the whole of why this
//! module exists rather than a row in the table `mixengine-shim`'s `trusting` keeps.
