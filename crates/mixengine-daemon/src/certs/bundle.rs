//! Writing `etc/ca/bundle.pem`, and when — roadmap task **T132**.
//!
//! [`mixengine_core::generate::ca`] composes the file; this is the two lines that fetch its inputs
//! and the one rule about failure. The machine's roots come from
//! [`TrustStore::roots`](mixengine_platform::TrustStore::roots) — the OS store on all three systems,
//! read unprivileged — and the authority comes off disk.
//!
//! **Nothing here can fail a daemon start.** A machine whose store cannot be enumerated is one
//! whose runtimes are told nothing and go on working exactly as they did before this task existed;
//! a daemon that refused to start over it would be strictly worse. `mix doctor` is where the gap is
//! reported, and its repair is this function.
