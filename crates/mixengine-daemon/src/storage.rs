//! Applying `--runtimes`, `--packages`, `--data` and `--logs`, and answering `--storage` — roadmap
//! tasks **T144** and **T145**.
//!
//! **The one place on this binary where a flag writes the home rather than configuring the
//! process.** Every other flag here — `--log-level`, `--index-url`, `--update-url` — says something
//! about this run and is forgotten when it ends. These four say something about the home, and they
//! have to: `runtime_installs.install_path` and `services.data_dir` are stored strings, so a
//! relocation that applied to one process would let a daemon a service manager started and one a
//! terminal started disagree about where the same home's runtimes are, while the database agreed
//! with neither. `mix runtime list` would print paths that are not there and nothing would say why.
//!
//! **Three outcomes, and the second is what makes the flag usable at all.** A value that differs
//! from what the file says is written, while the window [`storage::changeable`] describes is still
//! open. A value equal to what the file says writes nothing and complains about nothing, so a
//! launchd plist or a shell alias may carry the flag for the life of that plist rather than working
//! once. A value that differs after something has been installed fails the start — the reasoning
//! `--log-format` already carries on this binary: *fails the start rather than being ignored*,
//! because a daemon that quietly ran with its data somewhere other than where it was just told to
//! put it is the same defect with more at stake.
//!
//! **And one read that creates nothing**, which is [`report`]: the screen that offers the choice is
//! drawn before there is a daemon to ask, so the answer has to come from a process that can open a
//! database — and it must not be the reason a home, a configuration file or a database exists.
