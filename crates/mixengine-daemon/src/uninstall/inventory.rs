//! What MixEngine has written on this machine — roadmap task **T87**.
//!
//! **One enumeration, and both methods call it.** `daemon.uninstall_plan` renders it;
//! `daemon.uninstall` renders it, acts, and calls it again to measure. Two enumerations — one for
//! the dry run and one for the real run — is the second inventory the roadmap sentence refuses, and
//! it is the one that would actually have been built.
//!
//! **Nothing here writes and nothing here enqueues.** Every reading is one `mix doctor` already
//! takes, through the same `mixengine-platform` capability, which is what *"reads the same
//! inventory"* means: what is shared is the **readers** and not [`DoctorReport`]. That document
//! answers *is this as it should be?* and this one asks *is any of ours there?* — and
//! [`Outcome::Ok`] does not mean the same thing across its own rows. `Ok` on the trust check means
//! the authority **is** installed; `Ok` on the hosts check means the block **matches** what the
//! sites need, which on a wired machine is an *empty* block. An uninstall driven off that would
//! remove the trust store and skip the hosts block on one machine and do the reverse on the next
//! (the T87 design, D1).
//!
//! **A reader that fails is [`Removal::Failed`] and never [`Removal::Absent`].** An uninstall that
//! reported "nothing there" because it could not look is the one failure mode this whole feature
//! exists to prevent.
//!
//! [`DoctorReport`]: mixengine_proto::DoctorReport
