//! `package.*`: what the index offers of the servers this build can run, what this machine has, and
//! the job that turns one into the other.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T31a**. [`crate::runtimes`] one namespace across, and deliberately built out of
//! the same pieces — the same [`Fetcher`], the same [`Jobs`], the same install-then-record ordering.
//! What is *not* repeated is the reasoning: why an install returns a job, why an install already
//! running is answered with its job rather than started twice, and why the row is written after the
//! rename are all written next door and are true here for the same reasons.
//!
//! # Only what this build can run is offered
//!
//! A [`Recipe`](mixengine_core::generate::Recipe) is what turns an unpacked directory into a service
//! that starts: which binary, which template, how to tell it is up. A package with no recipe is a
//! download that ends in a directory nothing can use — so it is not listed, and installing it is
//! refused before a byte is spent rather than at `service.create`, where the disk is already gone.
//!
//! Two MixEngine versions reading one index therefore answer differently, which is correct: the
//! question a person is asking is *what can I run*, and each of T33–T37 unlocks its own kind by
//! shipping the recipe in the same commit.
//!
//! # Runtimes are not packages
//!
//! PHP is installed through [`crate::runtimes`], into `runtimes/`, with a default version and a shim
//! that reads it. A second door to the same room would either duplicate all of that or produce a PHP
//! the shim cannot see, so the catalogue filter here is what keeps them apart: no runtime has a
//! recipe, so no runtime is offered.
