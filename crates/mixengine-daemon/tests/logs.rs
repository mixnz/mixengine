//! `GET /logs/service/{id}` against a real `mixengined` supervising a real, talkative process.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T16b**, and the half its unit tests cannot reach. That a ring hands over a tail and
//! a subscription under one lock is provable in one process; that a person watching a service sees
//! what it printed before they connected *and* what it prints afterwards, over a socket, from a
//! daemon that is also supervising it, is not. The seam between the two is the whole feature — see
//! `docs/decisions/0009-logs-travel-on-their-own-stream.md`.
//!
//! **The service is a `fakeservice` row**, rendered into a spec by the daemon's own generator (T30)
//! through a recipe compiled into debug builds only, so these are ignored in a release build for the
//! reason `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/service.rs` states: a release daemon has nothing that can run
//! one, and the tests would fail on a service that never starts rather than on what they assert.
