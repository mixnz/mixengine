//! `elevation.*` against a real `mixengined` over a real socket. Roadmap task **T40b**.
//!
//! **Nothing here calls `elevation.grant` successfully, and that is deliberate.** These tests spawn a
//! real daemon, which uses the real `Host` — a successful grant would be a real UAC dialog on the
//! machine running `cargo test`. The assertions about what a grant raises belong to the unit tests
//! beside `src/elevation.rs`, which can inject `mock::Host` and this suite cannot. Stated here so a
//! later reader does not "fix" the gap.
//!
//! Most rows here are put in the queue by opening the daemon's own database and calling
//! `mixengine_core::elevation::enqueue`, which is the honest way to prove the claim the table
//! exists for: the queue is on disk, so a daemon that did not write a row still reports it. The
//! producer T41 added is driven end to end by one test of its own, below — a site is created over
//! the socket, and an operation is found waiting that nothing in this file wrote.
