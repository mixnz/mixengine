//! The four relocation flags, against real `mixengined` processes — roadmap task **T144**.
//!
//! These cannot be written any other way. What the flags claim is about a **start**: that a value
//! reaches `config.toml` and then reaches `Paths`, that repeating it changes nothing, and that a
//! start which may not honour it stops rather than continuing with data somewhere else. The first
//! and the last are exit statuses of a process, and the middle one is a file two processes looked
//! at.
//!
//! Every test gets its own `MIXENGINE_HOME` in a `TempDir` **passed as `--home`** — rule 2 in
//! `docs/standards/testing.md`. Nothing here touches the network.
