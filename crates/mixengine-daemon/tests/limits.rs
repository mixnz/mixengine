//! `service.limits` and `service.set_limits` against a real `mixengined` over a real socket.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T68**, and the half no unit test reaches. That a job object or a cgroup accepts a
//! ceiling is provable in one process — `mixengine-platform`'s own tests do it. What is only
//! provable here is the seam: that a limit written by a *method* arrives at a process that is
//! **already running**, which is D7's whole promise, and that what comes back describes what this
//! machine will do with the number rather than the number alone.
//!
//! **The service is a `fakeservice` row**, rendered by the daemon's own generator through a recipe
//! compiled into debug builds only — so these are ignored in a release build for the reason
//! `tests/logs.rs` states: a release daemon has nothing that can run one, and the tests would fail
//! on a service that never starts rather than on what they assert.
