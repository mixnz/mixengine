//! One question, asked of whoever is at the keyboard, and the three things that can come back.
//!
//! **The only place `mix` reads its own standard input**, and it exists for one command: T64 says
//! `mix elevation grant` prints every operation and what each will literally change *before* the
//! prompt is raised, and printing is only half of that — a person who has just read a list of
//! changes to their hosts file has to be able to act on it.
//!
//! **The decision is what can be read, not `IsTerminal`.** A pipe is not a terminal, so a rule
//! written around `IsTerminal` would refuse an answer somebody deliberately piped in and — worse —
//! could not be reached by any test, since `Command` hands its child a pipe and never a console.
//! End of file is the condition that actually matters: it is what a cron job, a CI step and a
//! service manager look like, and it is exactly the case that must not raise a dialog nobody is
//! there to see. See [`Answer::Unanswerable`].
