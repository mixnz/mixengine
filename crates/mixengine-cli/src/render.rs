//! is a contract: whatever the daemon answered, serialised, with the client's own identity beside it
//! so a captured file says which `mix` produced it (`.claude/features/gui.md` calls this "copy
//! diagnostics"). The human one is a person's answer to "is it up, and which one am I talking to",
//! and leaves out anything they would not read.
