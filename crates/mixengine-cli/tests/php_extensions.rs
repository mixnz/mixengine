//! The generated ini set against a **real** PHP — roadmap task **T28**.
//!
//! **The terminal and the pool are why this suite exists.** Everything else is provable in one
//! process and is proved there: the merge, the ordering, the two `zend_extension` names, the sweep.
//! What cannot be proved there is that the set actually reaches PHP — through the shim on a terminal
//! *and* through the pool in a browser — and on Windows that is where it fails first, because
//! `curl`, `mbstring` and `intl` are shared modules there that only an ini switches on.
//!
//! It also settles what the design asserted rather than measured: that php-fpm's `SIGUSR2` picks up
//! a *newly enabled* extension. That fails quietly — a `zend_extension` PHP cannot load is a startup
//! warning, not a refusal to start — which is why every assertion below compares **loaded sets**
//! rather than exit codes.
//!
//! # What this suite is not in a position to say
//!
//! It once claimed the second half of that sentence too: that a bare `zend_extension = xdebug` is "a
//! spelling this PHP accepts". It was, and the generalisation was still wrong. PHP 7.2 added a
//! fallback that appends the shared-library suffix to a value the loader cannot open, so from 7.2 on
//! a *wrong* module name loads anyway; 7.0 and 7.1 hand it over verbatim and load nothing. Pinned to
//! 8.3.33, this suite could not have failed either way, and five modules were silently absent from
//! every PHP 7.0 this product installed.
//!
//! The module names are therefore judged where a branch can falsify them —
//! `mixengine-core/tests/php_modules.rs`, against every PHP in `MIXENGINE_PHP_RUNTIMES`. What is
//! proved here is the half that needs a home: that the set **reaches** PHP, through the shim on a
//! terminal and through the pool in a browser.
//!
//! **`#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, for `php_fpm.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns when
//! it finds no PHP is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
