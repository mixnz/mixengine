//! The nginx recipe against a **real** nginx — roadmap task **T37**.
//!
//! [`caddy.rs`](../caddy.rs)'s file for the other front end, and deliberately almost all of it is
//! this page's four constants: the sequence a front end has to walk lives in [`harness::frontend`]
//! and is driven twice, which is what the roadmap means by "a parity test suite running both
//! generators". A copy of the arc written out again here would be two things to keep in step, and
//! the one that drifted would be green while it drifted.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, for Caddy's reason: a test that quietly returns when
//! it cannot find an nginx is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke. The
//! `nginx` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fetches a real archive on all three systems.
//!
//! # What only a real nginx can answer
//!
//! Three of this recipe's decisions are guesses until this suite runs, and each one fails silently
//! in a different way if it is wrong:
//!
//! - **Whether `nginx -t` accepts a generated configuration at all**, with a Windows path in every
//!   directive that names one. That is the question the forward-slashed quoting exists for, and only
//!   nginx's own parser answers it.
//! - **Whether the prefix makes `include sites/*.conf` resolve where the recipe says it does** — in
//!   the staging directory while the rendering is being judged, and in `etc/nginx/` once it is
//!   installed. Get it wrong and validation passes over a directory nothing is in.
//! - **Whether `-s reload` reaches the master this daemon started.** A signal that found no pid file
//!   exits non-zero and is reported; one that found the *wrong* one would be worse, which is why the
//!   pid path is written into the same configuration every invocation is given.
//!
//! # The archive, whole
//!
//! Unlike Caddy, the fixture packs the entire unpacked tree rather than one binary: a generated
//! `nginx.conf` `include`s the archive's own `conf/mime.types` by absolute path, and a package
//! without it is one this recipe refuses while rendering. Packing the whole tree is also what makes
//! the `provides` map the suite publishes the same shape `mixengine-packages` publishes.
