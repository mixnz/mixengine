//! What a shared home is listening on — roadmap task **T76**, the first of two enforcement tests.
//!
//! **This test proves what is listening, not what is allowed through**, and the distinction is not a
//! quibble to skip over. Every connection here is made from the machine being scanned to its own
//! address, so none of them crosses the firewall: a machine with the web port open and everything
//! else blocked, and a machine with no firewall at all, pass this identically.
//!
//! What it *does* prove is the promise T74's first real run found broken — that sharing one site
//! does not put the rest of what MixEngine runs on the network. That defect was found with `netstat`
//! and not with a firewall, which is exactly the half this suite covers. The rule half is
//! `mixengine-core`'s `tests/firewall.rs` and the manual run recorded in the T76 design.
//!
//! **`#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, on `caddy.rs`' reasoning: a test that quietly returns when
//! it cannot find a front end is a green suite that proved nothing. Only a running server can be
//! asked what it bound.
