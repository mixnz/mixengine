//! The Memcached recipe against a **real** memcached — roadmap task **T35**.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped, for `caddy.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns when it
//! cannot find a memcached is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke. The
//! `memcached` step in `.github/workflows/_services.yml` fetches a real archive; without one, everything
//! here panics saying so.
//!
//! # This suite speaks the protocol itself, and has to
//!
//! Every other recipe's end-to-end suite asks the server a question through a client the package
//! published — `redis-cli ping`, `mariadb-admin ping`, `psql -tAc`. **This package is one file.**
//! `bin/memcached` is the whole archive, so there is nothing to ask with and the text protocol is
//! written out here: `version`, then `set` and `get`. That is the same thing `mixengine-packages`
//! does to smoke-test the artifact, and for the same reason.
//!
//! # The claim only a real run can settle
//!
//! **The configuration is the command line.** This is the one recipe in the catalogue that renders
//! no file, so what would be a rendering to read back is instead a server that has to *behave* as
//! the flags say — listening where the row put it, and reachable there. A memcached given a flag it
//! does not understand exits rather than falling back, which is what makes the start itself the
//! check that every flag this recipe writes is one this build accepts.
