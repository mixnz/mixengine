//! The MariaDB recipe against a **real** MariaDB — roadmap task **T33**.
//!
//! Everything else about this recipe is provable in one process and is proved there: the template
//! renders with every path quoted, the settings merge, the spec builds, the file and the readiness
//! check name one port, the bootstrap SQL says what it does. None of that says the thing the task is
//! about, which is that *a data directory MixEngine bootstrapped becomes a database that answers a
//! query as the root it generated a password for*. That claim can only be made against the server.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, for `caddy.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns
//! when it finds no MariaDB is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
//!
//! **This suite needs a credential store**, which is the one way it differs from the other two: the
//! root password has exactly one home, and a machine with none refuses the bootstrap by design. On
//! Windows and macOS the store is part of the OS; on Linux `.github/scripts/test-no-network.sh`
//! starts a `gnome-keyring` on a session bus of its own, which is why the Linux leg runs this from
//! inside that script rather than beside it.
//!
//! # Why nothing in here ever reads that credential
//!
//! It did, once, and macOS is where that stopped. A keychain item carries an ACL naming the
//! application that created it, so the daemon reads its own credential without a word and **any
//! other process asking for it raises a dialog** — on a CI runner, one nobody can answer. Measured:
//! the whole suite bootstrapped, started and reached `running` in twenty-six seconds and then sat in
//! that read until the job's own timeout killed it, twenty-seven minutes later.
//!
//! It is not worth a `cfg`, because the assertion it was making is made better without it. **The
//! service reaching `running` is the proof**: its ready check is an authenticated `mariadb-admin
//! ping`, whose password the daemon resolves out of the keyring at spawn, so a store that held
//! nothing, or held the wrong thing, could not produce a running service. Everything else this
//! suite asks the server is a connection that must be **refused** — which needs no credential at
//! all, and says what a successful query never could: that there is no way in without one.
