//! The arc a front end has to walk, whichever program is being asked to be one — roadmap task
//! **T37**.
//!
//! `.claude/roadmap/phase-3-services.md` asks T37 for "a parity test suite running both generators",
//! and this is the parity: one sequence of assertions, driven twice. What each front end supplies is
//! a [`FrontEnd`] — where its archive is, what its overrides are called, which line in the rendering
//! carries its control port — and everything a *user* meets is here, once.
//!
//! **Why it is one sequence and not two files that look alike.** The claim T31 made for Caddy and
//! T37 makes for nginx is the same sentence: a row becomes a configuration the server itself
//! accepts, the server comes up, an edited override is *served* by the same process a moment later,
//! a broken one is refused with the last good configuration still live, and a stop ends it. Two
//! copies of that would drift — and the copy that drifted would be the one nobody was reading on the
//! day it mattered, because both suites would still be green.
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** shared is how each server answers its own readiness: Caddy has an
//! admin endpoint and nginx has a `server` block MixEngine renders for the purpose. Those live in
//! the recipes, and each suite asserts its own in its own file.
