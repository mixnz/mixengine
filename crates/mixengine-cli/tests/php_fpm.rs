//! The php-fpm recipe against a **real** PHP — roadmap task **T32**.
//!
//! Everything else about this recipe is provable in one process and is proved there: the template
//! renders, the settings merge, the spec builds, the file and the readiness check name one socket.
//! None of that says the thing the task is about, which is that *a pool MixEngine configured serves
//! a PHP script*. That claim can only be made against the program, so this suite is made against the
//! program — and it is made through the FastCGI protocol, because a pool that is listening and
//! cannot execute anything accepts a connection exactly like one that works.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, for `caddy.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns
//! when it finds no PHP is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
//!
//! **The two systems diverge here on purpose, and the divergence is the assertion.** On Unix the
//! pool is php-fpm on a socket and a changed override is handed to it by `SIGUSR2` — so the same pid
//! serves the new configuration. On Windows it is `php-cgi.exe` on a port with no signal to send, so
//! the running process keeps its old configuration and the suite asserts *that* rather than
//! pretending the two are the same.
