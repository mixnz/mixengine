//! What a browser gets from a site with more than one thing behind it — roadmap task **T135**.
//!
//! The rendering assertions in the two recipes say what the files contain; this says what is
//! *served*, which is the claim the design makes. Four things the text cannot prove on its own:
//! that a prefix matches at a segment boundary rather than as text, that the upstream's path really
//! replaces the matched prefix, that a longer prefix wins over a shorter one whatever order they
//! were typed in, and that the site's own kind still answers everything no route matched.
//!
//! **One sequence, driven twice**, on `frontend.rs`' rule and `welcome.rs`' arrangement: the claim
//! is the same sentence for both servers and the directives are not, so two files that looked alike
//! would drift and the one that drifted would be the one nobody was reading.
//!
//! **No PHP, and the gap is worth stating.** The targets this suite drives are a proxy and a
//! directory, which is everything the prefix rules can be measured with; a php-fpm route would need
//! a runtime download to measure a `fastcgi_pass` that `php_site.rs` already proves. What is left
//! uncovered is that shape's *text* — the nested `location ~ \.php$` inside `location ^~ /admin/`,
//! which `recipes::nginx` asserts and no server here reads. It is the one thing in T135 that is
//! asserted rather than served, and it is the shape T124a's leak came from, so a suite that later
//! has a PHP to hand should drive it.
//!
//! **The upstreams are two `TcpListener`s in this process**, answering the request line back. That
//! is what makes the rewrite visible: an upstream that echoed nothing would let `/abc` → `/xyz`
//! pass as long as *something* answered.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped, for `php_site.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns when it
//! finds no front end is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
