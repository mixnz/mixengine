//! Importing a blueprint somebody else wrote, and running its own command — roadmap task **T78a**.
//!
//! What is proved here is the whole of the task end to end and what no unit test can: that a
//! hand-written blueprint arrives *untrusted*, that its `[scaffold]` command does not run because
//! the apply was sent, and that it does run — in the new project's directory — when somebody says
//! so with the gesture an unsigned blueprint takes.
//!
//! **Offline by construction**, as `tests/blueprint.rs` is: the fixture is a static site with no
//! runtime and no services, so nothing here reaches the package index. The command the blueprint
//! carries is written per operating system by this file, which is the honest consequence of running
//! it through the OS shell.
