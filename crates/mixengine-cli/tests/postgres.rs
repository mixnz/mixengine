//! The PostgreSQL recipe against a **real** PostgreSQL — roadmap task **T34**.
//!
//! Everything else about this recipe is provable in one process and is proved there: three files
//! render with every path quoted, no line of `pg_hba.conf` says `trust`, the spec builds, the file
//! and the readiness check name one port, the ritual sets a password without writing one to disk.
//! None of that says the thing the task is about, which is that **a cluster MixEngine bootstrapped
//! becomes a server that answers an authenticated query with the password MixEngine generated**.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**: a test that quietly returns when it finds no
//! PostgreSQL is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
//!
//! **This suite needs a credential store**, as `mariadb.rs` does and for the same reason — the
//! superuser password has exactly one home and the ritual refuses a machine with none. On Linux
//! `.github/scripts/test-no-network.sh` starts a `gnome-keyring` on a session bus of its own, which
//! is why the Linux leg runs this from inside that script rather than beside it.
//!
//! **And on Windows it needs T34a.** `postgres` refuses a token holding an enabled
//! `BUILTIN\Administrators`, and this repository's Windows runner holds one deliberately (T2b) — so
//! before T34a this suite could not have run there at all. That it runs is the assertion T34a buys.
//!
//! Nothing here ever reads the credential, for `mariadb.rs`' measured reason: a macOS keychain item
//! carries an ACL naming its creator, and any other process asking raises a dialog nobody on a
//! runner can answer.
//!
//! # The reload is not exercised here, and that is a gap with an owner
//!
//! `pg_ctl reload` is in the spec and asserted where it is written — see
//! `recipes::postgres::postgres_reloads_the_same_way_on_every_system`. What cannot be driven from
//! out here is *asking* for one: there is no `service.reload` in
//! [`rpc`](mixengine_proto::rpc::method) and no `mix service set`, so a running server has no way to
//! be handed a changed file and told to re-read it. Nothing in T34 could have added one without
//! adding an RPC and a subcommand this task did not ask for. The claim this suite makes is
//! therefore the bootstrap and the credential, and the reload waits for the task that gives a
//! service a way to be reconfigured.
