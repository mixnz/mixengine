//! The Caddy recipe against a **real** Caddy — roadmap task **T31**, driven through T37's harness.
//!
//! Everything else about this recipe is provable in one process and is proved there: the template
//! renders, the settings merge, the spec builds, the registry hands a changed rendering to a running
//! service. None of that says the thing the task is actually about, which is that *Caddy accepts
//! what MixEngine generates and does what MixEngine asks it to*. That claim can only be made against
//! the program, so this suite is made against the program.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, and the difference is the point. A test that quietly
//! returns when it cannot find a Caddy is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download
//! broke; an ignored one is *visibly* not run, and the `caddy` step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
//! fetches a real archive on all three systems and runs it. Without one, everything here panics
//! saying so.
//!
//! **The arc itself lives in [`harness::frontend`]**, and this file is what makes it Caddy's: where
//! the archive is, what its overrides are called, and which line of a Caddyfile carries the admin
//! port. `nginx.rs` is the same file for the other front end, and the two running the same sequence
//! is what T37 means by a parity suite. What is Caddy's alone — the admin endpoint answering for
//! both readiness and health — is asserted here.
