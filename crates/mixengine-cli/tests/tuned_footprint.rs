//! What a dev-tuned database template saves — roadmap task **T73**, measured.
//!
//! `../features/resource-isolation.md` says the config templates are *"tuned down for a dev
//! machine"*, and until T73 the database half of that sentence was not true: every number those
//! templates rendered was the value the server would have used with no configuration file at all.
//! This suite is what makes the claim checkable rather than asserted.
//!
//! # The gate is a difference, not a number
//!
//! Two MariaDB instances live in one home. `mariadb@main` takes the recipe's defaults;
//! `mariadb@stock` is reconfigured back to the server's own values — the size settings through
//! their keys, the directives the template states through `extra`, which renders last and wins.
//! Each is started **alone**, left to settle, read five times, and stopped before the other starts.
//!
//! **What is gated is `stock − tuned`**, and the choice is the point of the file:
//!
//! - An absolute budget on MariaDB's RSS would be a promise held hostage to next month's MariaDB,
//!   on a quantity this project does not control — which is exactly why `idle_footprint.rs` gates
//!   `mixengined` and merely reports the total beside it.
//! - A difference is the sentence the feature document actually makes, it is the only sentence a
//!   commit in this repository is responsible for, and it survives being measured on somebody
//!   else's runner: both readings come from one machine, minutes apart, from one binary.
//! - It fails in the direction that matters. **If the tuning does nothing, this goes red** — and
//!   "does nothing" is a real possibility rather than a rhetorical one, because RSS is memory that
//!   has been *touched*, not memory that has been *asked for*. A smaller buffer the allocator was
//!   never going to fault in would move no number, and an absolute budget would have passed while
//!   proving nothing.
//!
//! # The baseline this was landed with, and why it is worth knowing
//!
//! This file shipped one commit **before** the directives it measures, with both instances
//! rendering identical configuration, so that the method could be measured before anything depended
//! on it. Run 33322945686: MariaDB read **98.9 MB on Windows, 133.2 MB on Linux, 98.5 MB on
//! macOS**, and the two instances came within **0.0 %, 0.4 % and 0.0 %** of one another.
//!
//! That is what makes [`SAVED_AT_LEAST`] a gate rather than a hope: a difference above the noise
//! floor is a difference in the configuration, because the noise floor was measured rather than
//! assumed. It is also why the gate is a *fraction* — three machines gave three different absolute
//! readings, and next month's runner is a fourth.
//!
//! # One product, and why
//!
//! MariaDB alone. The `bench` job fetches Caddy, MariaDB, Redis and three PHPs; MySQL and
//! PostgreSQL would each cost an archive, a bootstrap and — on Linux — a second credential-store
//! dance, for a second copy of a difference this one already demonstrates. What their templates
//! need proved is that a real server *accepts* the file, and `mysql.rs` and `postgres.rs` in the
//! `test` job prove exactly that on all three systems.
//!
//! # Release, ignored, and a credential store
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because this belongs to the `bench` job rather than to `test`: two real databases
//! and a number a loaded runner can move should not stand between a correctness suite and its
//! answer. The comparison is asserted **only in a release build**, on `idle_footprint.rs`' rule — a
//! debug daemon is a different program. A debug run still measures and still prints.
//!
//! It needs a secret service for T33's reason: the MariaDB bootstrap refuses a machine with no
//! credential store. Windows and macOS have one in the OS; on Linux the `bench` job installs
//! `gnome-keyring` and wraps this command in a `dbus-run-session` of its own.
