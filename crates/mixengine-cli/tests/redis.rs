//! The Redis recipe against a **real** Redis — roadmap task **T35**.
//!
//! Everything else about this recipe is provable in one process and is proved there: the template
//! renders, the settings merge, the spec builds. None of that says the thing the task is about,
//! which is that *Redis accepts what MixEngine generates and does what MixEngine asks it to*. That
//! claim can only be made against the program, so this suite is made against the program.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, for `caddy.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns
//! when it cannot find a Redis is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
//! The `redis` step in `.github/workflows/_services.yml` fetches a real archive; without one, everything
//! here panics saying so.
//!
//! # The two claims only a real server can settle
//!
//! **The configuration is found at all.** `getAbsolutePath()` in Redis's `server.c` joins any path
//! not starting with `/` to `getcwd()`, so the recipe names `redis.conf` relatively beside a working
//! directory of its own — and whether that arrangement works is a question about the server's own
//! path handling on the system it is running on. A server started with a configuration it did not
//! find does not fail: it starts on **6379** with Redis's built-in defaults, which is a different
//! server on a different port and would answer a check written any less carefully than the one here.
//!
//! **The cache keeps nothing.** `save ""`, `appendonly no` and `SHUTDOWN NOSAVE` are three
//! statements in three places, and what makes them one behaviour is a key written, a restart, and
//! the key being gone. Asserting the template contains `save ""` proves the template contains
//! `save ""`.
