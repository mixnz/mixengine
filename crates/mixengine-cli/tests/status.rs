//! `mix` against a real `mixengined`, over a real endpoint.
//!
//! This is the test the whole of task T10 exists to pass, and none of it can be written any other
//! way: that the client and the daemon agree on which home they are talking about, that they agree
//! on the endpoint that home implies, and that a client which finds nothing there produces a daemon
//! rather than an error message. The pieces are mocked nowhere, because every one of those claims is
//! about two operating-system processes.
//!
//! It is also the guard on the one thing `mix` duplicates rather than shares. The daemon computes
//! `run/` through `mixengine_core::Paths` and the client computes it in `home.rs`, because `core`
//! carries `sqlx` — see the note there. Nothing but a run like this one would notice the two drifting
//! apart: a `mix` that looked in the wrong place would simply autostart a second daemon, forever.
//!
//! Every test gets its own `MIXENGINE_HOME` in a `TempDir` **passed as `--home`** — rule 2 in
//! `docs/standards/testing.md`. Nothing here touches the network; a Unix socket and a named pipe
//! are neither.
