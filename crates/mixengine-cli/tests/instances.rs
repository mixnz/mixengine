//! Two instances of one service, side by side — roadmap task **T36**.
//!
//! Everything a *single* instance needs is settled and proved by `mariadb.rs`. What is left is the
//! claim the vocabulary was built for and nothing had yet made: **a home may hold two of one
//! server, at two versions, and neither knows the other is there.** Every mechanism that claim
//! rests on already keys itself by service id rather than by package — the data directory
//! (`data/<package>/<instance>`), the socket, the log directory, the keyring address, the port a
//! row is given — so this suite is not testing a new feature. It is testing that those five
//! decisions, each made in its own task for its own reason, add up to the one thing they were made
//! for.
//!
//! **Two versions rather than two names.** `mariadb@main` on 11.4.12 and `mariadb@legacy` on
//! 10.6.28: two `packages` rows, two install paths, two `mariadbd` binaries whose `share/` layouts
//! differ, and a bootstrap whose every program upstream renamed between those lines. Two instances
//! of *one* version would share a parent row and prove only that two directories can have two
//! names, which the unit tests already say. The version each server reports in its own log is what
//! makes this suite's central assertion unfakeable: the marker in each data directory names the
//! version that bootstrapped it, and the two are different.
//!
//! **It is `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped**, and it needs a credential store, for `mariadb.rs`'
//! reasons — the module note there is the long version of both, and of why nothing here ever reads
//! a credential back.
