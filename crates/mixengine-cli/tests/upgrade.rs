//! A daemon started on a database an older build wrote — roadmap task **T89**.
//!
//! `crates/mixengine-core/tests/upgrade.rs` proves the schema migrates and the rows survive, inside
//! one process calling `Store::open`. What it cannot answer is whether the **product** starts on
//! the result: whether the daemon's readers cope with rows whose newer columns hold defaults, and
//! whether `mix` can list what was in the old file.
//!
//! One test and not a suite. Every schema claim is cheaper and clearer one layer down, which is
//! `docs/standards/testing.md`'s rule about which layer owns a behaviour; what only this can
//! prove is that the daemon starts and reads.
