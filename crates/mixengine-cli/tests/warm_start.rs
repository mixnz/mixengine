//! What three services cost to start together — **milestone M3**, measured.
//!
//! `../features/services.md` promises a number: *"Fresh install → `mix service start caddy mariadb
//! redis` → all three healthy in under 10 s on a warm cache."* Every recipe that sentence names has
//! a suite of its own against the real program — `caddy.rs`, `mariadb.rs`, `redis.rs` — and none of
//! them starts more than one server. Phase 3 closed fifteen of fifteen with its milestone
//! deliberately unclaimed for that reason, and this file is the claim.
//!
//! # Two numbers, and only one of them is a gate
//!
//! The promise says *fresh install* and *warm cache*, and on a real machine those are two different
//! runs. A fresh install has an empty data directory, so the first start is MariaDB's first-run
//! ritual — `mariadb-install-db` building a system schema, a generated root password reaching the OS
//! credential store — which is tens of seconds of work by design and which no ten-second budget was
//! ever about.
//!
//! So **the first start is reported and gated on nothing**: it is the number a person meets once,
//! and nobody has said what it should be. **The warm start is the gate**: the same three services,
//! already installed, already bootstrapped, already started and stopped, which is what a person
//! meets every day afterwards. Its median over [`RUNS`] rounds is what is held to [`BUDGET`].
//!
//! # What is timed, and why it is one command
//!
//! `mix service start` with no service named is *every declared service*, walked in dependency
//! order — which is what the milestone's three-service command line means, since the CLI's `start`
//! takes one id. And `mix` waits by default: the client returns once the daemon has walked the plan
//! rather than once it has accepted it, so the wall clock of that one process **is** the number,
//! with no polling of this suite's own in the middle.
//!
//! `running` is health rather than an accept, which is what makes "all three healthy" need no fourth
//! probe: Caddy's ready check is its admin endpoint, Redis's is a `PING`, and MariaDB's is an
//! authenticated `mariadb-admin ping` whose password the daemon resolves out of the keyring at spawn.
//!
//! # The failure this file would otherwise have is a pass
//!
//! Three services that never started are far faster than three that did, so every round asserts what
//! it timed: three services `running` after the start, three `stopped` after the stop, and exactly
//! one first-run job across the whole suite. A failed install, a service that was never created, a
//! `--no-wait` slipping into the arguments would each make the number *better*.
//!
//! # Release, ignored, and a credential store
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because this belongs to the `bench` job rather than to `test`: nine servers and a
//! number a loaded runner can move should not stand between a correctness suite and its answer. The
//! budget is asserted **only in a release build** — a debug daemon is a different program, and a
//! number measured there is about the profile rather than about the design. A debug run still
//! measures and still prints.
//!
//! It needs a secret service for T33's reason: the MariaDB bootstrap refuses a machine with no
//! credential store. Windows and macOS have one in the OS; on Linux the `bench` job installs
//! `gnome-keyring` and wraps this command in a `dbus-run-session` of its own.

        // the state changes above proved is *which* service is slow: on `bench (ubuntu-latest)` the
        // spread is entirely MariaDB's, and a round where it takes twelve seconds has caddy at 54 ms
        // and redis at 257 ms beside it — the same two numbers as a fast round, to the millisecond.

        // say is *why* `mariadb-admin ping` went on failing for twelve seconds, because that answer
        // is written by `mariadbd` and not by anything watching it. It goes to `logs/mariadb.err`,
        // named by the `log_error` this recipe renders.
        //
        // **And that log did answer.** Every slow round had the same shape: InnoDB up, then four to
        // thirteen seconds of nothing, then `Server socket created`. Between those two lines 11.4
        // runs `init_ssl`, and a server with no certificate configured generates a 4096-bit RSA key
        // there at every start — a prime search, which is why the same runner gave 4 s one round and
        // 13 s the next. The recipe now renders a leaf this home's authority signed (T99), with the
        // measurement beside it; `skip-ssl` was tried first and withdrawn, because an 11.4 client
        // with a password on its command line refuses a server without TLS. The two tails stay
        // printed: the next cause will need the same diagnosis.
