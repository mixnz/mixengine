//! What MixEngine costs when nobody is using it — roadmap task **T72**, measured.
//!
//! `../features/resource-isolation.md` publishes a number: *"Idle footprint (daemon + Caddy, nothing
//! else running): target < 60 MB RSS, ~0 % CPU."* Nothing in this repository measured it until this
//! file, and it is exactly the kind of number that decays quietly: no single commit makes a daemon
//! fat.
//!
//! # Two numbers, and only one of them is a gate
//!
//! **The total is reported and gated on nothing.** Measured in release, it is 58 MB on Windows,
//! 69 MB on Linux and 69 MB on macOS — and most of it is Caddy, a Go program this project neither
//! wrote nor can tune. A budget on that total would be a promise held hostage to next month's
//! release of somebody else's server, and it would go red for a reason no commit here could fix.
//!
//! **`mixengined` alone is the gate**, because it is the half that regresses when this code grows
//! and the half anybody here can do something about. That is `overhead.rs`'s shape — it gates the
//! resolution and prints the wall clock beside it — applied to a quantity rather than to a duration.
//!
//! # What is measured, and through what
//!
//! `rss_bytes` per subject from `mix metrics --json`, which is the daemon's own sampler from T71 and
//! therefore the same number a person reads off their own machine. Not a reading of this machine
//! taken beside the daemon: one mechanism, one answer.
//!
//! **The subject set is asserted before either number is.** A home where Caddy failed to start
//! reports one subject and a very good total, and a budget alone would call that a pass — which is
//! this measurement's failure that reads as success.
//!
//! # What this measurement honestly is not
//!
//! It is not *"after 30 idle minutes"*. The daemon being read has just installed a package, rendered
//! configuration and walked a start plan, and its RSS carries the high-water mark of all of it — an
//! allocator returns that to the operating system slowly, or not at all. A daemon that has been up
//! for an afternoon holds less.
//!
//! **That makes the number worse than a real idle machine's, which is why it is acceptable**:
//! passing here means passing comfortably there. A budget that errs strict is a budget doing its job.
//!
//! Restarting the daemon and letting the next one adopt Caddy would be much closer to an idle
//! machine, and cannot be done on two of the three systems: per [ADR
//! 0007](../../../.claude/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md), a daemon leaving
//! takes its whole job down on Windows and its immediate children on Linux, so there would be
//! nothing left to adopt and this would measure a daemon standing alone.
//!
//! # Release, ignored
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because this belongs to the `bench` job rather than to `test`, on `warm_start.rs`'s
//! reasoning: a number a loaded runner can move should not stand between a correctness suite and its
//! answer. The budget is asserted **only in a release build** — a debug daemon is a different
//! program, and a number measured there is about the profile rather than about the design. A debug
//! run still measures and still prints.

/// What `mixengined` alone may hold, in bytes.
///
/// **The gate, and the only one here.** Set from what it measures rather than from a target nobody
/// had: 21 MB on Windows, 25 MB on Linux, **30 MB on macOS**, all in release. Thirty-six is about a
/// fifth above the worst of the three, which is room for a feature and not room for a leak.
///
/// **Chosen against the worst system rather than the average**, because one number for three is only
/// honest if it fits the one that fits worst — and the first draft of this constant was 32 MB, set
/// before macOS had been measured, which would have left that system eight per cent of headroom and
/// gone red at the next feature. A budget nobody can meet is raised rather than investigated, which
/// is how a guard stops guarding.
///
/// macOS being the largest is most likely its 16 KB pages against the others' 4 KB — the same
/// working set rounds up further — but that is an explanation nobody here has measured, and the
/// budget does not depend on it being right.
///
/// **Raised from 36 MB on 2026-09-07, and the reason is written down because it is the one the
/// paragraph above warns about.** A week after T72 the daemon measured 31 MB on Windows, 30 MB on
/// Linux and 35 MB on macOS — five to ten more than the day the budget was set, on every system —
/// and the macOS reading sat within a megabyte of the gate for ten runs before a runner's noise
/// took it over, on a commit that changed a test file in another crate. Forty-two was the same rule
/// applied to the new worst: about a fifth above it, and an explicit non-answer to where the five
/// megabytes went — that question became roadmap task **T72b**.
///
/// **Lowered to 41 MB, T72b's own reading.** Of the growth, ~3.5 MB traced to `mix self-update`
/// (T88): a `reqwest::Client` built and never shared, plus the feed it eagerly fetches at every
/// start. The rest — everything else that landed the same week — measured under 1.5 MB combined,
/// too small and too spread across too many tasks to be one thing worth chasing; see the T72b
/// design's own reading of it.
///
/// The fix built one transport and handed clones of it to the package index, extension registry
/// and update feed clients instead of three independent ones — [the T72b
/// design](../../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-t72b-one-transport-for-three-signed-documents-design.md).
/// Re-measured on the same machine, release, five runs: 30.7–34.2 MB, worse than this document's own
/// numbers above are used to — noisier than the paired A/B this document's history was measured
/// with, most likely this machine under more background load by the time of the reading rather than
/// the fix itself, and written down rather than smoothed over. Forty-one is about a fifth above the
/// worst of the five, on the same rule as every number above it.
///
/// **What the fix did not do is make the eager fetch free.** The transport is shared; the network
/// round trip at every start and the `Feed` cached from it are not, and most of what was measured
/// before the fix is plausibly still there — a live TLS connection inside `reqwest`'s 90-second idle
/// window at the moment this test reads it, which is not the same claim as a leak, and not one this
/// task's numbers prove either way. Chasing that further needs a profiler rather than a second guess
/// at `pool_idle_timeout`, and is deliberately left as a reading nobody has taken yet rather than a
/// change made without one.
