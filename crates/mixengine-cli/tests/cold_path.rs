//! The first request to a site whose pool is asleep — roadmap task **T72a**, measured.
//!
//! `../features/resource-isolation.md` publishes a number: *"Cold path: first request to a stopped
//! site served in under 1.5 s."* Nothing measured it until this file, and on two systems of three
//! there was nothing to measure: a pool on a Unix socket had no idle probe, so it was never stopped,
//! so no request to it was ever cold. T72a is the probe; this is the budget.
//!
//! # Three pools, one sweep
//!
//! An idle policy is a whole number of minutes, so waiting per round would spend three minutes
//! standing still. One sweep stops all three pools; the three requests are then made one after
//! another and timed separately, and the wait is paid once.
//!
//! **The pools must be stopped by the sweeper and not by a person.** A service somebody stopped is
//! one the activator closes the connection on, deliberately — T70's D8 — because the tool must not
//! overrule its user. So this sets a policy and waits, rather than calling `service stop`.
//!
//! # Three versions rather than three copies
//!
//! `MIXENGINE_PHP_RUNTIMES` names them, and the `bench` job fetches **7.0.33, 7.4.33 and 8.3.33**.
//! The first is the floor this product offers, the second is the legacy version people still run,
//! and the third is what the `test` job pins. **Two of the three predate `pm.status_listen`
//! entirely**, so this is also the standing proof of T72a's decision to read the status page off the
//! pool's own socket: the day somebody reaches for the cleaner arithmetic, two thirds of this
//! measurement go red rather than a paragraph being disbelieved.
//!
//! Three numbers rather than one for a second reason: **a single CI measurement has misled this
//! project before**. The M3 warm-start bench is bimodal on ubuntu, where a red has meant a bad
//! minute rather than a regression. Three admit a median.
//!
//! # What is timed
//!
//! From the request to the last byte of the response, including everything MixEngine does not
//! control — Caddy's dial and its retry, the activator's accept, php-fpm's own boot, PHP compiling
//! the script. That is what the person waiting for the page experiences, and no share of it is
//! excused. **If it goes red, read it as a functional finding before reading it as a slow one.**
//!
//! # Release, ignored
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because this belongs to the `bench` job rather than to `test`, and the budget is
//! asserted **only in a release build** — `idle_footprint.rs`'s shape exactly. A debug run still
//! measures and still prints.
