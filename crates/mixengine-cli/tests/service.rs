//! `mix service` against a real daemon supervising a real process.
//!
//! Task **T19b**, and the reason it is an end-to-end test rather than a unit one: everything below
//! the client has been proved in its own crate — the registry walks a plan, the handlers answer
//! `service.*` — and what has never been proved is that a person typing four words gets a process
//! started and an exit code that means it. That claim spans two operating-system processes and a
//! socket, so nothing here is mocked.
//!
//! **The services are `fakeservice` rows**, written by `mixengine_testkit::declare` — which is
//! Phase 3's `service.create` in the same sense — and rendered by the daemon's own generator (T30)
//! through the fixture recipe in `crates/mixengine-daemon/src/services/fakeservice.rs`. So what a
//! test below writes is a *declaration*, exactly as a user's would be, and the whole path from a row
//! to a running process is the one under test.
//!
//! **The five that declare a service are ignored in a release build**, because that recipe is
//! compiled into debug builds only: a release `mixengined` has nothing that can run a `fakeservice`,
//! so the home declares something it cannot start and those tests would fail for a reason that has
//! nothing to do with `mix service`. `ignore` rather than `#[cfg]`, so `cargo test --release` says
//! why they did not run.
