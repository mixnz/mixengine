//! `mix elevation grant` against a real `mixengined`, over a real endpoint. Roadmap task **T64**.
//!
//! **Nothing here grants anything, and that is the point rather than a gap.** A successful grant is
//! a real UAC dialog, a real `osascript` prompt or a real `pkexec` on the machine running
//! `cargo test`; `crates/mixengine-daemon/tests/elevation.rs` says the same about its own suite. So
//! every test below drives the half T64 added — the screen that comes *before* the prompt, and the
//! three answers that stop there — and none of them passes `--yes`.
//!
//! That is also what makes the suite safe to run anywhere: the operating system is never reached,
//! because a client that could not be answered never calls `elevation.grant` at all.
//!
//! Rows reach the queue the way they will on a user's machine: a site is created, and `site.create`
//! asks for the hosts file the home now needs (T41). Until T41 there was no producer at all and this
//! suite wrote its own row through `mixengine_testkit::privileged`, which is gone with that change —
//! a test that creates a site and *then* finds an operation waiting proves what a fixture could not.
//!
//! There is no `mix elevation enqueue` and never will be: what needs an administrator's permission
//! is decided by the operation that needs it, and a command that let a person queue an arbitrary
//! privileged operation would be a client deciding what runs as root. See
//! `crates/mixengine-cli/src/main.rs`.
