//! `mix extension install/list/uninstall` against a real daemon — roadmap task **T81**.
//!
//! `extension_manifest.rs` proves the reading of a manifest; this proves the *doing*. What is only
//! true here, and is what the design spends its arguments on:
//!
//! - a `--path` install is marked unsigned wherever it is printed, for as long as it is installed;
//! - installing asks about what the extension declares before it installs anything, and `--yes` is
//!   the answer given in advance;
//! - the ports it holds are real, and appear in the listing;
//! - and an uninstall keeps the data directory, saying where it still is.
//!
//! The extension installed here runs nothing: its `[service]` names a program that does not exist,
//! which is fine because nothing starts it. What a *started* extension does is the supervisor's,
//! and it is the same walk `mix service start` takes — the design's D11.
