//! What a browser gets from a site with nothing behind it — roadmap tasks **T124** and **T124a**.
//!
//! The rendering assertions in the two recipes say what the file contains; this says what is
//! *served*, which is the claim the design makes. Three things the text cannot prove on its own:
//! that the exact-path route really matches one path, that an application's own 404 survives it,
//! and that the page stops appearing the moment the site has an index — **with no re-render and no
//! reload**, which is what makes "it disappears by itself" a property rather than a promise.
//!
//! **One sequence, driven twice**, on `frontend.rs`' rule: the claim is the same sentence for both
//! servers and the directives are not, so two files that looked alike would drift and the one that
//! drifted would be the one nobody was reading. It is also the arrangement this task needed — the
//! nginx rendering had to be written twice, the first serving a php-fpm site's own source as text,
//! and a suite that could only drive Caddy would have left the second version asserted and never
//! served.
//!
//! **The site starts with an `index.php` and this suite deletes it**, rather than building a fixture
//! with an empty document root. That is the stronger arrangement: the file is the only thing that
//! changes between the two answers, so a page that appeared for any other reason would not appear
//! here, and the front end is never told anything happened.
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d rather than skipped, for `php_site.rs`' reason: a test that quietly returns when it
//! finds no PHP is a green suite that proved nothing on the day the download broke.
