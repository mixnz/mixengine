//! Declaring a fixture service the way a person does: over the socket, through `service.create`.
//!
//! **What replaced half of [`crate::declare`]** in roadmap task **T31a**. Until the daemon had a
//! method for it, every suite that drove a service wrote its `services` row by hand — which meant
//! the row every supervision test ran against was one no shipped code path had ever produced. Now
//! the only row written by hand is the `packages` one ([`crate::declare::package`]),
//! because `fakeservice` is a fixture binary no index will ever publish; the service itself arrives
//! the way a user's does, and a difference between the two would fail a suite rather than hide.
//!
//! A small JSON-RPC client rather than driving `mix`, because what a fixture has to send is the
//! `overrides` document — how the fake service is to behave — and the command line deliberately has
//! no flag for handing a service arbitrary settings.
