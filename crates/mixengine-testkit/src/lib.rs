//! The fixtures every test suite in this workspace shares.
//!
//! Seven things live here: a home directory that exists only for the test that made it, a way to
//! stop a process this test is not the parent of, the `fakeservice` binary the supervisor is
//! tested against (`.claude/standards/testing.md`,
//! `.claude/architecture/process-supervision.md`), the `services` row a test has to write for
//! itself until T30 can create one, a signed package index over a real socket, and a real archive
//! to install from it.
//! The first two were each written twice somewhere else before they were written once here; the third arrives here first, because the four crates that will spawn it
//! could not have shared it anywhere but a package of its own; the fourth is scaffolding with an
//! expiry date on it — see [`mod@declare`]; the next two exist because the network is forbidden in
//! tests and what they stand in for is a network; and the seventh is a FastCGI client, because a
//! test that proves php-fpm is up by connecting to its socket proves only that something is
//! listening — see [`mod@fastcgi`].
//!
//! **A dev-dependency and nothing else.** Nothing in this crate may end up inside `mixengined`,
//! `mix` or `mixengine-elevate`, which `crates/mixengine-proto/tests/workspace_layering.rs` checks
//! rather than trusts. That is what makes the exception in [`process`] affordable: it is a `#[cfg]`
//! that ships to nobody.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here is anything that would answer a question a test is asking. A
//! fixture that computed a path the way the daemon computes it would make a suite agree with itself
//! by construction — so [`Home`] restates the three conventions it needs, out loud, and the tests
//! that care keep the two answers side by side. See [`Home::run_dir`].
