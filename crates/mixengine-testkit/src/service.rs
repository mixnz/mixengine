//! `fakeservice` — the program supervision is tested against.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/process-supervision.md` names it and says what it has to be able to do:
//! start slowly, never become ready, exit with a code after N ms, ignore a request to stop, or leave
//! a child behind that outlives it. Every one of those is a supervisor policy that only a real,
//! badly behaved process can exercise — and none of them should be exercised against real MariaDB,
//! which is slow and hides the races this is meant to expose.
//!
//! This module is the *caller's* half. The program itself is `src/bin/fakeservice.rs`, and the two
//! are deliberately separate: a supervisor test does not spawn it, it hands
//! [`program`](FakeService::program) and [`args`](FakeService::args) to a `ServiceSpec` and lets the
//! supervisor do the spawning. [`FakeService::spawn`] exists for the tests that are about the
//! fixture itself.
