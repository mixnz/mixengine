//! Stopping a process this test is not the parent of.
//!
//! **The one `#[cfg]` outside `mixengine-platform` that decides what a program *does*.** Test
//! functions elsewhere are gated to the systems they can run on — `tests/fakeservice.rs` has two —
//! and that is a different thing: it says where a claim is checkable, not how it is answered. This
//! is a body that differs by OS. It is here rather than
//! behind a platform trait because nothing in the *product* stops a process by pid yet — that
//! arrives with the supervisor (roadmap task T15), and is where this belongs once it exists. A test
//! cannot wait for it: what several of them prove is precisely that a daemon somebody *else* stopped
//! shuts down properly, and a daemon a client autostarted is nobody's child to be killed through a
//! `std::process::Child`.
//!
//! It is affordable because this crate is a dev-dependency and ships to nobody. The rule it bends is
//! about the code that runs on a user's machine; obeying it here would mean adding a capability to
//! `mixengine-platform` that only tests call, which is the same `#[cfg]` in a worse place.
