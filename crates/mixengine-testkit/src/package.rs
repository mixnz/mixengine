//! A real archive, in each of the three shapes the publishing pipeline produces.
//!
//! `.claude/standards/testing.md` named this before it existed and said what it is for: *a tiny
//! tarball/zip with a known SHA-256, for install flows without the network*. What it must not be is
//! a stand-in for unpacking — the install pipeline's most interesting steps are the checksum, the
//! entry-path check and the mode bits, and every one of them is a property of a genuine archive.

//! # It is written with different implementations than it is read with

//! Deliberately, and on the same principle as [`MockRegistry`](crate::MockRegistry) signing with
//! `minisign` while the product verifies with `minisign-verify`: `.tar.zst` is compressed here by
//! the reference C library through `zstd` and decompressed in the product by the pure-Rust
//! `ruzstd`. A fixture built with the implementation it is then read by proves only that the
//! implementation agrees with itself.
//!
//! # The hash is computed here, and stated to the test
//!
//! [`Packed::sha256`] is what the caller puts in the index it serves. Asking the code under test for

//! [`Home`](crate::Home) avoids by restating the paths it needs rather than computing them.
