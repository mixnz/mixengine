//! A package index served over a real socket, signed with a real key.
//!
//! `.claude/standards/testing.md` forbids network access in tests and CI blocks egress to enforce
//! it, so everything that reads an index has to read one from here. Deliberately **not** a fake
//! `Client`: the parts most worth testing are the signature check and the cache policy, and a
//! double that skipped either would be a test of the double.
//!
//! # It generates its own key, and that is the point
//!
//! A test cannot hold the production private key, so [`MockRegistry`] makes a fresh keypair per
//! instance and hands out its public half for `mixengine_core::index::Client::with` — named in
//! prose rather than linked, because this crate does not depend on `mixengine-core` and must not
//! start. That forces the key to be injectable in the product rather than hard-wired, and an
//! injectable key is what lets `MIXENGINE_INDEX_URL` point at a team mirror at all.
//!
//! The signature is produced by `minisign`, the signing half of the same author's pair of crates
//! that `minisign-verify` is the verifying half of. So a test proves the client accepts what
//! minisign actually produces, rather than what we believe it produces — which is the difference
//! that matters, since the format has a legacy variant the client refuses on purpose.
