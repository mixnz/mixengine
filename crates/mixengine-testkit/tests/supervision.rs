//! A supervised process cannot outlive what supervises it — as far as each system can promise that.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T13**, and the inverse of `an_orphan_outlives_the_process_that_left_it_behind` in
//! `fakeservice.rs`: the same fixture, the same `mixengine-platform`, and the opposite outcome
//! asserted.
//!
//! **These live here rather than in `crates/mixengine-platform/tests/` for one reason**: the
//! processes under test are `fakeservice`, which is a binary of *this* package, and
//! `CARGO_BIN_EXE_…` reaches only the package the test is in. Having `mixengine-platform`
//! dev-depend on this crate would be a dependency cycle to answer a question about where a file
//! sits. What is being tested is still `mixengine_platform::process`, which this crate depends on
//! in the ordinary way.
//!
//! # The oracle is a lock, not a pid
//!
//! Every assertion below is "the lock at this path can now be taken". That is deliberate and it is
//! most of the work of this task. `try_stop` answers a question about a *number* — on Unix `kill`
//! succeeds against a zombie, so a process that has exited and not been reaped still reports as
//! present — and a supervision test that used it would pass for a process that is gone and for one
//! that is merely unreaped alike. A lock is released by the kernel when the process really ends and
//! by nothing else, on both families of system, killed or not. `FakeService::hold_lock` is the
//! fixture side of it.
//!
//! # What each system is allowed to promise
//!
//! `docs/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` sets it out, and the last two
//! tests here are that ADR written as code: a **killed** supervisor takes its child down on Windows
//! (the job object, a kernel guarantee) and on Linux (`PR_SET_PDEATHSIG`), and takes nothing down
//! on macOS, where crash recovery at the next boot (roadmap task T18) is what covers it. The macOS
//! test asserts the gap rather than skipping it, so that a day someone closes it is a day a test
//! fails and says so.
