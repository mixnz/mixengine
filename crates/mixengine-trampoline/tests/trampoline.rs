//! The trampoline on its own, with no shim and no home behind it — roadmap task **T185**.
//!
//! What it does *with* a shim is `crates/mixengine-shim/tests/shim.rs`', which fills a real `bin/`
//! and runs every case through it. This file is for the one thing it answers by itself: a `bin/`
//! with no pointer to the resolver.
//!
//! **It is also what gets the binary built.** `cargo test --workspace --all-targets` puts a
//! package's binary in `target/<profile>/` only for a package with an integration test, and the
//! shim's and the CLI's suites look for `mixengine-trampoline` there; without this file a clean CI
//! build never made one (found by the first CI run of T185).

/// Copied into a directory of its own under a command's name, the way `shims::refresh` places it,
