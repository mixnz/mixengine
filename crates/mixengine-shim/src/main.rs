//! `php`, `node`, `npm`, `python`, `ruby` — one binary, copied into `<root>/bin` under each of those
//! names, that works out which version this directory means and then gets out of its way.
//!
//! This is the program that makes `cd project-a && php -v` and `cd project-b && php -v` disagree
//! with no shell hook installed, which is Phase 2's milestone. Four steps, and the interesting thing
//! about each of them is what it does *not* do:
//!
//! ```text
//! 1  which command is this?        argv[0], against `core::shims::COMMANDS`
//! 2  which version does it mean?   `core::resolve`, in this process — no daemon, no IPC
//! 3  which file is that?           the `provides` map recorded when it was installed
//! 4  become it                     exec on Unix, a Job Object child on Windows — carrying `PATH`
//!                                  and the generated ini set (T28), and nothing else
//!
//! For `composer`, steps 2 and 3 run twice — once for the file, once for the PHP that runs it —
//! and step 4 starts the PHP with the file first (roadmap task T27c).
//! ```
//!
//! # It has no arguments of its own, and cannot have
//!
//! Every argument belongs to the program being fronted: a `--home` flag here would be one `php`
//! could never be given, and `php --version` has to reach PHP rather than print ours. So the only
//! input beside `argv[0]` is the environment — `MIXENGINE_HOME` for which install this is, and
//! `MIXENGINE_PHP` (per kind, [`RuntimeKind::override_env`]) for a version chosen for one command.
//! **That is also why there is no `--json`, no logging and no `--explain`**: anything this printed
//! on its own account would be a line in the middle of somebody's `php -r` output.
//!
//! # Why it links `mixengine-core` when `mix` deliberately does not
//!
//! `mix` avoids that edge because it can ask a daemon, and a bundled SQLite is a poor trade for
//! finding out where a socket lives. Here there is nothing to ask: the whole promise is that a
//! version resolves **without a daemon** — with one stopped, still starting, or never installed —
//! and in a budget (15 ms, T29) that a connection, a request and a response would spend before the
//! query even started. So the resolution is the same `core::resolve` the daemon and the GUI call,
//! run in this process against the database opened read-only.
//!
//! # What it is not allowed to do to the home
//!
//! Read it. [`Store::open_read_only`] does not create the file and does not migrate it, and SQLite
//! is what enforces that rather than our remembering: a schema upgrade decided by whichever `php -v`
//! ran first, possibly several at once from a build script, is the one thing `mixengine.db` cannot
//! afford. A home that has never had a daemon in it is an error here, not a home this creates.
