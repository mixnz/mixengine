//! Keeping a Go to the release a directory resolved to — roadmap task **T27d**.
//!
//! The archive's `go.env` says `GOTOOLCHAIN=auto`, which lets a `go.mod` asking for a newer Go
//! download that Go and run it instead of the one installed. What is asserted here is what the
//! program a shim starts really inherits: `GOTOOLCHAIN=local` for `go`, nothing for any other
//! language, and a value the person exported arriving exactly as they wrote it.
