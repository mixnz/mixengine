//! A home the way an install leaves one, and the shim binary sitting in its `bin/`.
//!
//! It lives here rather than in `mixengine-testkit` for the reason the CLI's own harness gives:
//! none of it is about MixEngine, it is about *this* suite — a fake runtime unpacked where
//! `provides` says it is, and `bin/` filled through the product's own [`shims::refresh`] so that
//! the `php` these tests run is the file a daemon start would have put there.
//!
//! **No `MIXENGINE_HOME` is ever set in this process.** Every case sets it on the child's own
//! `Command`, which is what `.claude/standards/testing.md` requires and what lets these run in
//! parallel: `std::env::set_var` is process-global, and two homes in one binary would overwrite
//! each other.

// Each integration test binary compiles this module separately, so anything `shim.rs` uses and
// `overhead.rs` does not is dead code in one of them. The alternative is two fixtures that build a
// home slightly differently, which is the one thing a benchmark and the suite it is measured
// against must not have.
