//! Telling a runtime about this home's certificate authority — roadmap task **T133**.
//!
//! The third complaint this phase answers, end to end: a Node process fetching
//! `https://ezweb.test` reported `unable to verify the first certificate` while a browser on the
//! same machine showed a padlock on the same site. Both were right. MixEngine installs its
//! authority into the **operating system's** trust store, and no language runtime reads that store
//! — Node ships a set of its own, Ruby's OpenSSL resolves a file inside the moved tree, Python uses
//! OpenSSL's defaults and `certifi` above them, and PHP's Windows artifact ships no CA file at all.
//!
//! What is asserted here is which variable each language is handed and which file it names, because
//! the difference between the two files is the whole design: `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS` **adds** to what
//! Node already trusts, so Node is handed the authority itself; every other mechanism **replaces** a
//! trust store, so those are handed the merged bundle and keep the public internet.
