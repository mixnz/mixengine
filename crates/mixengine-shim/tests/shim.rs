//! The shim as a user meets it: a file in `bin/`, run from a directory, with no daemon anywhere.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T25**, and the claim this suite exists for is Phase 2's milestone — `php -v` in
//! one directory and `php -v` in another are two different programs, with no shell hook installed
//! and nothing running in the background. Everything here drives the **real binary** as a child
//! process, because the two things worth proving about a shim are exactly the two an in-process
//! test cannot reach: that it reads the name it was invoked by, and that the exit code a shell sees
//! is the program's own.
//!
//! `fakeservice` stands in for every runtime here, as it does for the install tests: the real
//! artifacts are tens of megabytes each, and downloading one to find out which of two directories a
//! shim resolved would be a suite that needs the network to answer a question about a database.
//! What a fake proves here is what the shim does rather than what a runtime is: it has to do
//! what a shim asks of any program — record the environment it was handed, prove it received its
//! arguments, and exit with a status of its choosing — and `--dump-env`, `--touch` and `--exit-code`
//! are those three.
//!
//! **No `MIXENGINE_HOME` is ever set in this process.** Each case sets it on the child's own
//! `Command`, which is what `.claude/standards/testing.md` requires and what lets these run in
//! parallel: `std::env::set_var` is process-global, and two homes in one binary would overwrite each
//! other.
//!
//! The home itself is in [`harness`], shared with `overhead.rs` — T29 measures what a shim costs
//! and this file measures what it does, and the two must be asking about the same installation or
//! the budget is a number about a home nobody has.
