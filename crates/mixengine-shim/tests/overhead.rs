//! What a shim costs, and which half of that the budget is about.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T29**. [`../features/runtime-versions.md`](../features/runtime-versions.md) puts a
//! number on step 2 of the shim and on nothing else — *"Calls `resolve` (in-process, reading SQLite
//! read-only + walking for `mixengine.toml`) — **no IPC**, so it stays fast even when the daemon is
//! down. Target: **< 15 ms** overhead, enforced by a bench"* — and that sentence is the reason
//! `mixengine-shim` links `mixengine-core` at all. A promise nothing measures is a design decision
//! nothing is holding to account, so `resolving_a_version_stays_inside_the_budget` is the bench it
//! asks for.
//!
//! # Two measurements, and only one of them is a gate
//!
//! **The resolution is gated**, because it is what this workspace decides: opening the database
//! read-only, walking for a manifest, and looking up which file the artifact publishes. Anything
//! that would make it miss — a shim that asked the daemon after all, that parsed `config.toml`, that
//! fetched an index — is a regression this fails on, which is the whole job.
//!
//! **The wall clock is measured, reported, and gated on nothing**, and that is a decision rather
//! than an omission. What a person waits for when they type `php -v` is dominated by process
//! creation: on Unix the shim `exec`s and there is one process either way, but on Windows there is
//! no `exec`, so the design starts a child inside a Job Object and waits — a whole second process
//! creation that no amount of care here removes. What this file printed on the three CI runners,
//! at p50, with the gated resolution beside it:
//!
//! ```text
//!             program alone   through the shim   difference   resolution
//!   ubuntu          1.06 ms            3.26 ms      2.19 ms      0.74 ms
//!   macos           3.11 ms            7.66 ms      4.52 ms      0.58 ms
//!   windows         8.63 ms           23.54 ms     15.03 ms      1.71 ms
//! ```
//!
//! The two Unix rows are the shim's own image load and then an `exec`. The Windows row is that plus
//! an entire second process, and it lands **on** the 15 ms line — so a wall-clock budget would flap
//! across it from run to run while saying nothing about the resolution, which is nine times inside
//! its own budget on that same machine. A budget there would be a budget on the runner's process
//! model, and a pessimistic one on top: `fakeservice` is a one-megabyte binary where the `php.exe` a
//! real shim fronts is sixty, so this fixture overstates the shim image's share by a wide margin.
//! Where the Windows time goes was taken apart on a developer machine rather than in CI: a shim that
//! only loads and refuses to dispatch costs 16 ms of the 30 ms a full run took there, so it is the
//! two images and the two creations, not anything between them. The numbers are printed on every
//! run, so a regression in them is visible in the log, and `really_ran` is what keeps them
//! measurements of a shim that really became something.
//!
//! **Since T185 the Windows row has a third process in it.** `bin/php.exe` there is the trampoline,
//! which runs the shim for the resolution and then starts the program itself; the extra creation
//! measured 10–15 ms on a developer machine against a full chain whose run-to-run noise was wider
//! than that. The table above predates it.
//!
//! # The failure this file would otherwise have is a pass
//!
//! A shim that resolves nothing is far faster than one that hands over, so a broken home, an empty
//! `bin/`, a fixture that stopped being copied would each make these numbers *better*. Every run is
//! therefore checked — the wall clock against the program's own output, the resolution against the
//! path it answered. That guard has earned itself once already: it caught a stale
//! `target/release/fakeservice`, a binary from before `--version` existed, which
//! `cargo test -p mixengine-shim` does not rebuild. The CI job builds it explicitly because of that.
//!
//! # Release, and ignored
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d because these belong to the `bench` job and not to `test`: a hundred and fifty
//! processes and a number a loaded runner can move should not stand between a correctness suite and
//! its answer. The budget is asserted **only in a release build** — a debug SQLite is a different
//! program, and a number measured there would be about the profile rather than about the design. A
//! debug run still measures and still prints, so nothing here can rot unnoticed.
//!
//! **`--test-threads=1`, and it is not a nicety.** Cargo runs the two tests below in parallel by
//! default, and each of them spends its whole time creating processes — so each measures the other.
//! Run together the end-to-end difference reads 34 ms and run one at a time it reads 21, on the same
//! machine within the same minute. The CI step says so; a person running this by hand should too.
//!
//! They run on all three systems rather than on Linux alone. The gate is the same everywhere, but
//! what it runs over is not: SQLite's locking, the cost of opening a file and the walk from a
//! directory to the root are each per-OS, and the reported wall clock is the only place the
//! difference between `exec` and a Job Object child is ever written down as a number.
