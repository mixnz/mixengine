//! The MixEngine handbook, embedded at compile time.
//!
//! One Markdown corpus lives at `docs/guide/{en,vi}/` and is published three ways: as a static site,
//! as raw Markdown at predictable URLs, and — through this crate — compiled into `mix docs`, which
//! answers with **the same bytes** and needs no daemon. Roadmap task T90; ADR 0021 in
//! `docs/decisions/` is why help is not an API method.
//!
//! Nothing here parses anything. The front matter is read by `build.rs`, which writes the metadata
//! out as constants beside an `include_str!` per file, so the cost of embedding the whole handbook
//! is the bytes and no more.
