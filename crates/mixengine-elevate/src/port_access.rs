//! What port access may be granted, decided by the binary that will grant it.
//!
//! **The helper validates the request itself rather than trusting the daemon** —
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md`, and the T42 design, D5. If the daemon is compromised it
//! *is* the attacker, so nothing the request asserts can be believed: not the binary, not the ports,
//! not the numbers a redirect names. This module is the whole of that decision, next door to
//! `hosts.rs`, which is the same shape for the same reason.
//!
//! **Ownership by the caller is the strongest assertion available.** The helper cannot be told where
//! `MIXENGINE_HOME` is, because the daemon is what would be telling it and the daemon is the thing
//! being guarded against — but the filesystem already knows who wrote the file, and the request's own
//! identity is established exactly that way.
//!
//! **The rule text is rendered here and never accepted.** A redirect carries two numbers; what goes
//! into a file root owns is built from them by `mixengine_platform::port_access`, so there is no
//! string in the request that could become a packet-filter rule of somebody else's choosing.
//!
//! What this cannot stop is a compromised daemon pointing the grant at a binary of its own choosing:
//! nothing here can tell that binary from a real front end. The control is T64 — the whole path is
//! printed before the user approves it, which is what that task was built for. See D11.
