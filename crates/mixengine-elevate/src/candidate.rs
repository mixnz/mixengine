//! Deciding whether a replacement helper deserved the prompt it is about to be installed by —
//! roadmap task **T88a**.
//!
//! **This is the only place in MixEngine where a signature is checked by a process running as
//! root.** Everything else the updater verifies is verified by the daemon, which runs as the user
//! and is, if it has been compromised, the attacker. `.claude/features/updates.md` calls this the
//! single most important rule on its page: an auto-updated binary that runs as root, with no OS
//! signature, is a local privilege-escalation vector — so the copy already installed, in a
//! directory an ordinary account cannot write, is the one that decides.
//!
//! # Read once, verify those bytes, write those bytes
//!
//! [`read_verified`] hands back the bytes it checked, and its caller writes **those**. Nothing
//! re-opens the file. The candidate lives in a directory the caller owns, the caller is the party
//! this binary is written not to trust, and a `verify(path)` followed by a `copy(path, …)` is a
//! check that can be stepped past by swapping the file in between. A refactor that turns the
//! `Vec<u8>` back into a path is the one plausible-looking change that would break this module.
//!
//! # What the signature does not say, and is checked beside it
//!
//! That the bytes are ours does not make them *this machine's*, and a helper that cannot be loaded
//! is a machine with no elevation left and no way back but a reinstall. Nor does it make them
//! *newer*: "only we can sign" bounds an attacker to our own past releases, which is the entire
//! content of a downgrade. Both facts travel in the signed trusted comment, which is what
//! [`HelperStamp`] reads — minisign's global signature covers that comment, and `minisign-verify`
//! hands it over only after the signature has verified.
