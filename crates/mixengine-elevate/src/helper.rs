//! Putting this binary where only an administrator can rewrite it.
//!
//! **The source is this process's own image and the destination is a compiled-in constant** — the
//! T85 design, D2. There is nothing here for a caller to aim: the operation carries no field, so a
//! compromised daemon gains no *copy this file as root* primitive from this existing. That is the
//! same reasoning `docs/architecture/security-model.md` refuses `Exec { cmd }` with, applied to
//! an operation whose whole job is a file copy.
//!
//! **The directory is checked before it is used**, on the rule the whole binary follows.
//! [`create_root_owned_directory`] re-asserts the owner and the permissions on every call, so a
//! directory that already exists converges on the right *permissions* — but one that already exists
//! and belongs to somebody else is a target that was arranged, not a convenience, and that is what
//! ownership refuses. Its own documentation says so; this is the caller it is talking about.
//!
//! **[`install`] decides nothing about whether an upgrade deserves to be installed**, and it
//! cannot: the binary it copies is its own image, so a check it made would be a check made by the
//! thing being checked. On a machine with nothing installed that is the only candidate there is,
//! and `docs/architecture/security-model.md` states the residual plainly rather than hiding it.
//!
//! **[`replace`] is the one that decides** — roadmap task **T88a**. It runs only as the
//! *installed* copy, in a directory an ordinary account cannot write, and it checks a detached
//! minisign signature over the candidate against a key compiled into itself. See
//! `crate::candidate`.
