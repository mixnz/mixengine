//! Deciding what may enter this machine's trust store, and what may leave it — roadmap task
//! **T49a**.
//!
//! **The two directions are not symmetrical, and this file is arranged around that.**
//!
//! An install is close to harmless. A daemon compromised badly enough to forge one already holds the
//! private key of the authority this machine trusts, and can sign any certificate for any name
//! without installing a second root — so the shape check below is not a boundary against an
//! attacker. It is there so that `mix cert ca-uninstall` (T54) and uninstall (T87) can **enumerate**
//! everything an install could ever have created, which an unconstrained one would make impossible.
//!
//! A removal is not harmless. One that could name an arbitrary certificate could take the root that
//! validates Windows Update out of this machine, through this audited binary and under the user's
//! own Allow click. The wire type therefore carries **no fingerprint at all** — see
//! `mixengine_proto::privileged::TrustTarget` — and what arrives is eight hex characters, checked
//! here before a store is opened and checked again against every certificate the store hands back.
