//! What may be written into the hosts file, decided by the binary that will write it.
//!
//! **The helper validates the request itself rather than trusting the daemon** —
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md`, and the T41 design, D3. If the daemon is compromised it
//! *is* the attacker, so nothing the request asserts can be believed: not the address, not the
//! domain, not the size of the list. This module is the whole of that decision and is meant to be
//! read in one sitting.
//!
//! The table it reads is a compile-time constant shared through `mixengine-proto` (D4). Being handed
//! a list of permitted TLDs *in the request* would be the trust this rules out; sharing a constant
//! is not. This binary is excluded from auto-update, so its table can be older than the daemon's —
//! and that is the correct failure: a TLD a future build manages is refused here, loudly, at its own
//! index.
