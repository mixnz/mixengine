//! What may be routed where, decided by the binary that will route it.
//!
//! **The helper validates the request itself rather than trusting the daemon** —
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md`, and the T45 design, D3 and D5. If the daemon is
//! compromised it *is* the attacker, so nothing the request asserts can be believed: not the TLDs,
//! not the port, not the length of the list.
//!
//! **And the one thing that would matter most is not in the request at all.** The nameserver
//! address, the Linux link's name and address, and the Windows registry key are compiled into this
//! binary, in `mixengine_platform::resolver`. An operation that accepted an address would be one
//! that let whoever owns the daemon point this machine's name resolution anywhere — with a valid
//! signature, through this binary, under the user's own Allow click. The request carries the two
//! things this binary cannot know and nothing else: which of the managed TLDs, and which port the
//! server is listening on.
//!
//! The table it reads is the compile-time constant shared through `mixengine-proto`. This binary is
//! excluded from auto-update, so its table can be older than the daemon's — and that is the correct
//! failure: a TLD a future build wires is refused here, loudly, at its own index.
