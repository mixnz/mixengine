//! Reading a request, and refusing one that cannot be trusted.
//!
//! Every refusal here is a refusal of the **whole request**: exit 65, and no response file. That is
//! the distinction the exit codes turn on — a bad operation inside a good request is exit 0 with an
//! outcome at that operation's index, and never reaches this module.
//!
//! **The identity of the caller is the owner of the file.** The daemon runs as the user, and if the
//! daemon is compromised it is the attacker, so nothing this document asserts about who is asking is
//! believed. The daemon wrote the file while running as the user, so the filesystem already knows.
