//! it *is* the attacker, so nothing the request asserts can be believed: not the ports, not the
//! label, not the length of the list.
//!
//! **And this one cannot check the question it would most like to ask.** The resolver's helper can
//! compare a TLD against a table compiled into itself; "is this a web port" has no such table,
//! because a site's HTTP port is a column in a database this binary must never read. So it refuses
//! what is provably not a web port instead, and that is enough to hold the rule the feature exists
//! to keep: *databases, caches, Mailpit and the daemon API are never exposed*. A plan naming 3306
//! is refused here even if every layer above it agreed to send one.
