//! Running one of a service's own programs — a health probe, a shutdown command — and waiting for
//! what it says.
//!
//! `mariadb-admin ping`, `pg_isready`, `redis-cli ping`, `caddy stop`: short-lived programs shipped
//! *with* the service, run for an exit status. The spawn itself is
//! [`mixengine_platform::process::run_once`], because a `Command` on Windows has to be told not to
//! be given a console window and no crate above the platform layer may say so. What this module
//! adds is the one thing the platform call cannot know: **where** such a program is run.
//!
//! # A probe runs where the service runs
//!
//! [`Surroundings`] is a service's working directory and the environment it was actually started
//! with, and handing both to its own commands is not a convenience. `mariadb-admin` finds the socket
//! it should ask about through `HOME` and the same generated config the server read; a credential
//! reaches it through the environment, which is the whole point of `EnvValue::Keyring`
//! (`docs/decisions/0006-servicespec-in-proto-and-secret-free.md`) and is why it must not travel
//! in an argument list every process table on the machine can read. A
//! probe given the daemon's surroundings instead would be asking a well-formed question about a
//! different server, and answering it would be worse than not asking.
