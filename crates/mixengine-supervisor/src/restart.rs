//! What to do when a supervised process ends.
//!
//! Three answers, and they are the three states a service can be left in — which is not a
//! coincidence but the reason the type has three variants. A service that ended the way it was meant
//! to is [`Decision::Rest`] and `Stopped`; one that is going to be started again is
//! [`Decision::Restart`] and `Restarting`; one nothing is going to be done about is
//! [`Decision::GiveUp`] and `Failed`.
//!
//! # Why a crash loop is counted in a window
//!
//! Retrying forever against a port that is never going to be free is the failure mode this exists to
//! prevent, and the naive fix — a total attempt limit — is wrong in the other direction: a service
//! that crashes once a day and is restarted would exhaust a budget of five some time in the second
//! week and stay `Failed` for no reason anybody could reconstruct. So failures are counted *inside a
//! window*, and one that falls out of it is forgotten.
//!
//! Becoming healthy again does **not** clear that history, which is deliberate. A service that
//! starts, works for four seconds and dies, five times in a minute, is exactly a crash loop — and
//! the version that cleared the count on every success would restart it forever while reporting
//! that everything was fine. What recovery does reset is the *backoff*, because the next wait should
//! start at half a second again rather than at thirty.
