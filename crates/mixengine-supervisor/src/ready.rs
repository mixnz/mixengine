//! *Can traffic be routed to it yet?*
//!
//! A started process is not a started service. `mariadbd` accepts on its port seconds after it is
//! spawned and answers queries seconds after that; php-fpm creates its socket before it has forked a
//! single worker. Everything a site depends on hangs off the moment a `ReadyCheck` passes, which is
//! why the spec has five of them rather than one.
//!
//! # Three answers, not two
//!
//! Waiting for readiness races three outcomes, and the third is the one a naive implementation
//! misses: the process **exits** while we are waiting for it. The port was taken, the config did not
//! parse, the data directory belongs to another version. Treating that as "not ready yet" means
//! waiting out the whole timeout — thirty seconds of a service that has been dead for one — and then
//! reporting the wrong thing. `Starting → Restarting` is an edge in the state machine for exactly
//! this reason (see `docs/architecture/process-supervision.md`), and [`Ready::Exited`] is what
//! feeds it.
//!
//! # What a check that cannot be made answers
//!
//! [`Error::UnsupportedCheck`] rather than a `todo!()`, per the rule in `CLAUDE.md`, and after
//! roadmap task T15a there is exactly one shape of it left in this module: a `ReadyCheck` variant
//! added to `mixengine-proto` since this was last read. An `https://` URL is the other, and the
//! crate's `http` module is where that is explained — the checks a spec has any business writing
//! here are on the loopback interface, where there is nothing to encrypt.
