//! Everything a service says, split into lines, written down and kept where the last of it can be
//! read back.
//!
//! Three readers of one stream, and deliberately not three copies of it. The ring and the
//! subscription came with T15, which needed them for the crash-loop tail — that is the difference
//! between a GUI saying "failed" and one saying "address already in use" — and for
//! `ReadyCheck::LogPattern`, a service announcing itself on a stream nobody can poll. T16 added the
//! third: the file under `logs/services/<service-id>/`, written from the same place the other two
//! are fed from and under the same lock, so all three agree on what was printed and in what order.
//! The one way a line reaches fewer than three is a disk that refuses it, and that is reported
//! through `tracing` — into `daemon.log`, where the supervisor's own voice belongs — rather than
//! passed over in silence.
//!
//! **T16b took the third out of this crate rather than into it.** Publishing
//! `DaemonEvent::LogLine` and serving `GET /logs/{id}?follow=1` both start from a `ServiceId` and
//! have to find the [`Capture`] it belongs to, and that registry is the daemon's; what it does is
//! forward this capture into a log of its own, keyed by service and outliving any one run of the
//! process.
//!
//! **What that forwarding needs is [`Capture::read`] and not [`Capture::subscribe`]** — T16c, and
//! the correction to the sentence that used to stand here. A subscription begins when it is made,
//! and [`Capture::start`] has the reader threads on the pipes before it returns: a service printing
//! in that window filled this ring and the file, and reached a later subscriber never. `read` hands
//! over what is already here together with the subscription, under the lock the reader threads
//! publish on, so the forwarded log holds every line exactly once.
//!
//! # What the file is
//!
//! **Plain text: exactly what the service printed, one line per line, and nothing of ours.** A
//! `current.log` is read by whoever reads MariaDB's or Caddy's log — with their own tools, their own
//! greps, and their own expectations about what a line looks like — so a timestamp or a `[stderr]`
//! tag in front of it would break every one of those to restate what the ring and the event carry
//! anyway. The two streams interleave into that one file in the order the reader threads saw them,
//! which is the order the service wrote them in, and the tag that says which is which lives in
//! [`LogLine::stream`].
//!
//! Line endings are normalised to `\n` on the way through, because the file and the ring have to
//! hold the same line: a Windows service writing CRLF and a Unix one writing LF are the same output.
//!
//! # Threads, not tasks
//!
//! One thread per stream, reading a blocking pipe, and that is deliberate rather than a shortcut.
//! `spawn_supervised` hands back the standard library's pipes, and an anonymous pipe on Windows
//! cannot be read with overlapped I/O at all — `tokio::process` gets around that by creating named
//! pipes for its own children, which is not what this crate spawns. So the choice is a thread per
//! stream or a polling loop that would either add latency to every line or spin; a blocking read on
//! a thread is what `docs/standards/rust.md` means by "a dedicated task".
//!
//! **Since T16 that thread also writes the file, unbuffered, one line per call.** Said plainly
//! because it cuts against the paragraph above: the reason to drain a pipe promptly is that a
//! service blocks on a full one, and a disk that stalls now stalls the drain. It is still the right
//! way round — a buffered write is a `current.log` missing exactly the lines that explain a crash,
//! and a queue between the two would be a second copy of the stream with its own bound to overrun —
//! but it means a log directory on a network mount is a service's problem and not only a log's.
//!
//! The threads end when the pipe reaches end of file, which happens when every process holding the
//! write end has exited — not when the service does. A worker it forked, or a grandchild that
//! inherited its stdout, keeps a thread alive after the service itself is gone. Stopping a service
//! closes that gap by killing its whole group; a service that *crashed* has had no such stop, which
//! is why [`Capture::finish`] waits with a deadline rather than joining the threads outright.
