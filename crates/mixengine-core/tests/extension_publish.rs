//! Generating `extensions.json` — roadmap task **T81a**.

//! `tests/extension_registry.rs` proves the *reading* half against a signed document over a real
//! socket. This is the half that makes the document, and the two meet in one place worth naming:
//! what `assemble` returns is fed straight back through [`Registry::listing`], so a document this
//! build could not read is one it refuses to hand over rather than one it signs.
