//! No firewall rule left behind — roadmap task **T76**, the second of two enforcement tests.
//!
//! `docs/features/lan-sharing.md` promises that *disabling sharing leaves no firewall rule
//! behind, verified by enumerating rules by label*. This is that verification, and it is the half
//! `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/sharing.rs` explicitly cannot make: that suite asks what is
//! *listening*, from the machine to its own address, which never crosses a firewall at all.
//!
//! **Windows only, and CI's answer rather than a developer's.** Two reasons, and both are properties
//! of the systems rather than of this build. `ufw` has no comment field on a plain allow — see
//! `mixengine_platform`'s `firewall::unix_tools` — so a rule MixEngine wrote on Linux cannot be
//! found again by name, which makes "enumerating by label" a claim about one system. And writing a
//! rule at all needs a full token: CI's Windows third runs these suites under one and `cargo test`
//! on a developer's machine does not, so this skips itself rather than failing where it was never
//! able to run.
//!
//! **`mixengine-elevate` is run directly**, the way `tests/elevation.rs` runs it: going through the
//! daemon would raise a real UAC dialog at whoever is running the suite.
