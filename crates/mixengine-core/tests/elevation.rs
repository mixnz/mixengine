//! The seam nothing else touches: the document this crate writes is one the shipped helper accepts,
//! and the report the shipped helper writes is one this crate can read.
//!
//! **No token and no prompt.** `mixengine-elevate` is run directly, as this user, which is possible
//! only because T40/D5 made `Probe` the operation that does not require elevation — the operation
//! whose job includes reporting whether the token is elevated has to work when it is not. What is
//! under test is the file protocol across the two crates, not the launcher: raising a prompt is
//! `mixengine-platform`'s and is asserted in its own suite.
//!
//! Every test gets its own home in a `TempDir`, passed as a path — rule 2 in
//! `docs/standards/testing.md`.
