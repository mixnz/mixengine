//! The three site tables: what is served out of a project's directory, and at what name.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T39a**. [`crate::projects`]' shape one table down, with the difference that makes
//! this module worth having: a site is *three* rows in three tables, and they are only ever right
//! together. `0001_initial.sql` says so at `site_domains_one_primary_per_site` — "at least one is
//! not expressible here … and it stays an invariant the site module upholds inside the transaction
//! that creates a site". This is that module and that transaction.
//!
//! # One place reads these tables
//!
//! `projects.rs` does not gain a `sites_of` and `services.rs` does not gain a `sites_declaring`,
//! though a site belongs to a project and declares services. Both questions are reads of `sites`,
//! and a second door onto a table is a second answer to a question that has one — the rule that put
//! the project walk in one place in the first place. They are [`records`] and [`declaring`] here.
//!
//! # Domains are an ordered list, and the head is the primary
//!
//! `is_primary` never leaves this module. Above it a site has a `Vec<String>` whose first element is
//! the primary, so "no primary" and "two primaries" are not states anything can spell. A replacement
//! deletes every row before it inserts any, which is what lets a domain move from one site to
//! another in two calls rather than being blocked by the unique index halfway through (spec D6).
