//! Tools somebody installed into a runtime — roadmap task **T131**.
//!
//! `npm install -g yarn`, `pip install poetry`, `gem install rails`. Each of the three package
//! managers has a *bindir* it writes programs into, that directory is **inside the runtime's own
//! install**, and no part of it is ever on anybody's PATH — only `<root>/bin` is, and until this
//! module that directory was a projection of a compile-time constant. So the tool existed, ran
//! perfectly well when named by its full path, and could not be typed.
//!
//! Measured rather than reasoned about, on the reference machine:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ node -e "console.log(process.execPath)"
//! …/runtimes/node/24.19.0/node.exe
//! $ npm config get prefix
//! …/runtimes/node/24.19.0
//! ```
//!
//! # Why this is not "put the runtime's directory on the PATH"
//!
//! A global tool belongs to **one version of one language**. `yarn` installed under Node 24 is not
//! installed under Node 22, and a PATH entry pointing at one install would make `cd`-ing into a
//! project that pins the other run the wrong program — silently, which is the exact failure the
//! whole shim exists to prevent. So a discovered tool becomes a *name* ([`crate::bin_commands`]),
//! and the file behind it is resolved at run time against whichever version the working directory
//! means, exactly as `npm` itself is.
//!
//! # What is not discovered
//!
//! [`scan`] refuses four families, and each of them for its own reason:
//!
//! - **A compiled command.** Somebody who runs `npm install -g npm` has an `npm` in their Node's
//!   bindir; fronting it would make `bin/npm` a shim that dispatches to a file found by a shim, and
//!   the first file it would find is itself.
//! - **The runtime's own programs**, by the artifact's `provides` map. `node` is already a command
//!   and `php-config` is already a command.
//! - **[`RESERVED`]** — MixEngine's own binaries, which a person may reasonably have copied
//!   anywhere and which must never be shadowed by a shim.
//! - **A file this operating system does not execute.** npm writes `yarn`, `yarn.cmd` and
//!   `yarn.ps1` for one tool; three files in `bin/` would be one command and two that do nothing.
//!
//! **What it deliberately does not refuse is a name that shadows a program already on the PATH.** A
//! globally installed package called `git` would put a `git` ahead of the machine's own, and every
//! version manager that fronts global tools has that property. `mix doctor` reports it; refusing it
//! would mean deciding on somebody's behalf that a tool they installed is not one they meant.
