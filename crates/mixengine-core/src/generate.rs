//! Turning declared state into configuration on disk, and into something the supervisor can run.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T30**. Two halves of one job, which is why they are one module:
//!
//! - **Config generation.** Every managed service's configuration is rendered from a template plus
//!   the user's overrides into `etc/<service-id>/`, atomically, skipping what has not changed and
//!   installing nothing that fails validation. That is [`document`] and [`settings`].
//! - **The `ServiceSpec` in front of it.** A `services` row is not a spec — it carries
//!   `package_id`, `port`, `data_dir`, `config_overrides_json` and `limits_json` — and what turns
//!   one into a runnable specification is the same knowledge that renders its config: a [`recipe`].
//!
//! So this module is also the answer to the port `mixengine-daemon` has been asking through since
//! T19 (`SpecSource`), and the thing that answers it is [`Generator`]. Before this, the daemon's
//! shipped source was `Undeclared` — an empty set, honest for a build that could not render a spec
//! at all.
//!
//! # What is generated is never read back
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md`'s rule, and this module is where it is kept: nothing here parses a file under `etc/`
//! into state. The only read is [`document::install`] comparing a rendering against what is on disk
//! to decide whether to write it, which is a *checksum* rather than a parse — it can tell you the
//! file is the one we would write, and it can tell you nothing about a file that is not.
//!
//! # Rendered on every walk
//!
//! [`Generator::declared`] renders and installs, and the registry asks it at the top of every
//! `service.*` call. That sounds like a lot of writing and is almost none: the diff in
//! [`document::install`] means a home whose state has not changed does no I/O beyond reading each
//! file once. The alternative — rendering only when something is started — leaves the two able to
//! disagree, and the way that is discovered is a service reloading a config from before the change
//! the user just made.
