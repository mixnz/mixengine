//! Which port a new service is given — roadmap task **T34c**.
//!
//! MariaDB and MySQL name the same default, and so do two instances of either, which is one problem
//! and not two. `docs/features/services.md` answers it in one rule and this module is that rule:
//! **a port is allocated once, when the row is written, and never computed again.** What a recipe
//! names is a wish ([`Recipe::preferred_port`]); the first row to ask for it is given it, and the
//! next is given the first free port above.
//!
//! Three things it has to get right, and each of them is a test below.
//!
//! **Free means free on the machine, not free in the table.** 3306 on a developer's machine is
//! routinely held by an XAMPP, by Windows' own `MySQL80` service or by a container nobody
//! remembers, none of which has a `services` row — so the question is asked by *binding* the port,
//! and a preferred port lost to a program MixEngine does not manage is reported with as much of
//! that program's identity as the OS will give up (T38) rather than renumbered in silence. The
//! table is consulted as well and for the opposite reason: a stopped MariaDB holds 3306 as surely
//! as a running one, because the number is in its rendered configuration and in somebody's `.env`.
//!
//! **The search is bounded.** Running out of it is an error, not a longer loop — see
//! [`Error::PortsExhausted`](crate::Error::PortsExhausted).
//!
//! **Allocating and inserting are one critical section**, or two `service.create` calls arriving
//! together are each handed the same next-free port and the second server fails to bind at start.
//! That lock is `hold`, and [`create`](super::create) takes it for every create rather than for
//! the allocating ones alone.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* here is moving a port afterwards: an allocated port belongs to its row
//! for as long as the row lives, because it is in a project's `.env` and in a colleague's shell
//! history by the end of the afternoon. Deleting whoever holds 3306 promotes nobody into it. Moving
//! one is a person's decision and a regeneration — `mix service set`, which does not exist yet.
