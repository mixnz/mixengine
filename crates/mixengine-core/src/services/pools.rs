//! The service a runtime install creates for itself — roadmap task **T32**.
//!
//! Nobody calls `service.create` for a pool. `docs/features/runtime-versions.md` decided this
//! before there was a pool to create: PHP's post-install hook makes the `php-fpm@<version>` record,
//! and an uninstall takes it away. What is here is that hook, and it is written **idempotent and run
//! at boot as well as after an install** — which is what gives a PHP installed before this task a
//! pool without a data migration, and what repairs a home whose row was deleted by hand.
//!
//! **The port a pool needs is no longer this module's arithmetic** — roadmap task **T34c**. It used
//! to keep an allocator of its own that walked the `services` table from 9000 and deliberately
//! asked the machine nothing, on the reasoning that a port free at install time may be taken by the
//! time the pool starts. That is still true and is no longer the whole story: what the two
//! databases forced is that a number this home writes down while an XAMPP is listening on it is a
//! service configured to fail, and a bind costs nothing here. So there is one allocator for every
//! service ([`ports`](super::ports)), the wish belongs to the recipe, and a pool gets its 9000 the
//! same way `mariadb@main` gets its 3306.
//!
//! **Which runtimes get one is the catalogue's answer, not a list here.** A recipe says where its
//! binary comes from ([`Source`]), so this walks the recipes rather than the languages: the day
//! `node` grows a supervised service, its recipe says so and this needs no edit.
