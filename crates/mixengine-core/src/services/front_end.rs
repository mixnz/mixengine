//! Which service is already the home's front end — roadmap task **T37**.
//!
//! `docs/features/services.md`: *exactly one of Caddy/Nginx is the active front end*. Until T37
//! there was one front-end recipe and the sentence could not be broken; with two, a home can hold a
//! `caddy` row and an `nginx` row, and what that is on the day sites arrive (T43) is two programs
//! generated against 80 and 443 with the second one failing to bind — or worse, succeeding, because
//! the first was stopped and half the sites are answered by a configuration nobody is looking at.
//!
//! **[`Instancing`] cannot say this and neither can a port.** Instancing is about how many rows may
//! name one package, and both front ends answer `Single`; the allocator would happily give the
//! second one 81, which is precisely the wrong kindness — a front end that has been renumbered is
//! not a front end. So the question is asked about the *role*
//! ([`Role::FrontEnd`](crate::generate::Role)) and answered where the row is written.
//!
//! [`Instancing`]: crate::generate::Instancing
