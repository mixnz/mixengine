//! What has to happen once, before a service is ever started — roadmap task **T33**.
//!
//! A [`Recipe`](super::Recipe) can describe a service completely and still not say "before this ever
//! runs, bootstrap a data directory and set a password in it". MariaDB is the first service that
//! needs it and PostgreSQL (T34) is the second, which is why this is a hook on the trait rather than
//! something inside one recipe.
//!
//! # Two halves, and the reason is the keyring
//!
//! A recipe lives in `mixengine-core`, which has no business reaching an OS credential store; the
//! daemon holds the [`Keyring`](mixengine_platform::Keyring) and is the only thing that should. So a
//! recipe **declares** what it needs — [`SecretSpec`] — the daemon generates the value and stores
//! it, and the value arrives back inside the [`Context`] the recipe is handed to build its steps.
//! One place makes a credential, and no recipe carries a platform call.
//!
//! **Storing comes before touching the disk.** The daemon writes to the keyring first and runs the
//! first step second, so a machine with no credential store fails while nothing has been created —
//! rather than half-way through, leaving a data directory whose root password exists nowhere.
//!
//! # Doing it once, and knowing which "once" this is
//!
//! Two marker files, and the pair is what makes cleaning safe — see [`inspect`].
