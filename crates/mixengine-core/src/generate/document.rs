//! Getting a rendered file onto the disk: diffed, staged, checked, and only then installed.
//!
//! Four rules, in the order they apply, and each of them exists because of what the *next* thing to
//! happen is — a web server being told to reload:
//!
//! 1. **Identical is not a change.** A rendering that byte-matches what is already there is not
//!    written at all, and [`install`] says so with [`Written::Unchanged`]. The caller's next move is
//!    a reload, and a service reloading because the daemon restarted — dropping connections, on
//!    `mariadb` re-reading a data directory — is a cost the user never asked for and cannot see the
//!    reason for.
//! 2. **The whole set is staged first.** Files go into a staging directory beside the destination,
//!    never into it, because a validator has to be shown a *complete* configuration: a Caddyfile
//!    that imports six site files cannot be judged with two of them from before this render.
//! 3. **Validation happens against the staging directory**, so a configuration that does not parse
//!    is one nothing was installed from. [`features/services.md`] requires exactly that: the
//!    previous config stays live and the error is surfaced.
//! 4. **The install is a rename per file.** Renaming within one directory tree is atomic on every
//!    filesystem this runs on, so nothing ever reads half a file — a web server whose reload races
//!    the write of its own config is the failure this rules out.
//!
//! Rule 4 is [`crate::install`]'s "the rename is the commit", one layer smaller: there it is a
//! directory of an unpacked runtime, here it is a config file. Unlike an install, this cannot be one
//! transaction across the set — several files cannot be renamed at one instant — and it does not
//! need to be: the set was validated as a set, and the window between two renames is microseconds
//! inside which nothing has been asked to reload yet.
//!
//! [`features/services.md`]: ../../../../docs/features/services.md
