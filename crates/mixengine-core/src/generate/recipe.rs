//! What this build knows about running one kind of service.
//!
//! A `services` row says *that* MariaDB 11.4 is installed as `mariadb@main` on port 3306 with these
//! overrides. It cannot say what MariaDB **is**: which binary starts it, which file it reads, how to
//! tell whether it is up, what stops it cleanly. That knowledge is a [`Recipe`], and it is compiled
//! into this build rather than carried in the package index — the index describes a *download*
//! (`provides`, `requires`, a checksum), and a template that has to change with a MixEngine release
//! cannot be published by a pipeline that runs on a different schedule.
//!
//! **A recipe is looked up by `packages.name`**, which is the one thing a row and a recipe agree on.
//! `mariadb@main` and `mariadb@legacy` are two rows, two data directories and two ports; they are
//! one recipe, and the difference between them is entirely in the [`Context`] it is handed.
//!
//! **The set this build ships is [`Catalogue::builtin`], and each entry in it is a roadmap task of
//! its own** — Caddy is T31 and is in ([`recipes::caddy`](super::recipes::caddy)), php-fpm is T32,
//! MariaDB T33, PostgreSQL T34, Redis and Memcached T35 — because each is a template, a set of
//! overrides worth having and a first-start ritual, judged against the real server. What T30 owns is
//! everything around them: the merge, the render, the diff, the staging and the [`ServiceSpec`] that
//! comes out. A catalogue is a value, so a test — and a debug build with a fixture to supervise —
//! composes its own.
//!
