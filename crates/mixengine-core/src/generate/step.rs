//! Lifted out of [`first_run`](super::first_run) when a second kind of work needed the same shape —
//! roadmap task **T77a**. A bootstrap and a database provisioning have nothing else in common, and
//! the thing they do share is not "what has to happen once before a service is ever started", which
//! is what the module it used to live in is named after.
//!
//! Both hand-written [`Debug`] impls came with it, and they are why this is a file rather than a
//! pair of struct definitions: a step may hold a generated password on its standard input, and
//! `docs/standards/rust.md` says a type that *might* hold a secret redacts it rather than
//! trusting every caller that ever writes `{:?}`.
