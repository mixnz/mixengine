//! Making a database and an account on MariaDB or MySQL — roadmap task **T77a**.
//!
//! **One builder for two recipes**, because this is genuinely one syntax. The two servers differ in
//! how they are *bootstrapped* — `--bootstrap` against `--init-file`, which is why T33 wrote them
//! two rituals — and not in how a database is made. Two copies would be two places to fix a quoting
//! rule, and `mysql.rs` carries the test that would notice them drifting apart.
//!
//! # Every host a local client arrives as
//!
//! The generated `my.cnf` says `skip-name-resolve`, so a client connecting over TCP to 127.0.0.1 is
//! matched as `'blog'@'127.0.0.1'` and never as `'blog'@'localhost'` — T33's finding about the root
//! account, and just as true of this one. The account is created for all three of `localhost`,
//! `127.0.0.1` and `::1`, and granted on all three.
//!
//! # `CREATE` and then `ALTER`, and why the pair is safe
//!
//! `CREATE USER IF NOT EXISTS` does nothing to an account that is already there, so the `ALTER` is
//! what brings a server that has drifted back into agreement with the credential store. It is only
//! ever aimed at an account MixEngine holds the password for: the daemon refuses the other case
//! before these statements are built — the design's D3, *a keyring entry is the deed of ownership*.
//!
//! # No character set, and nothing escaped
//!
//! The instance is already configured with a `character_set` and a `collation`, so naming one here
//! would be a second place deciding it — one that silently wins (design D7). And every identifier is
//! quoted while nothing is escaped, which is safe because
//! [`validated_identifier`](crate::generate::databases::validated_identifier) refused every
//! character that could end a quoted one.
