//! PostgreSQL: the other database MixEngine runs — roadmap task **T34**.
//!
//! **The second and last recipe with something to do before it can start**, after MariaDB: a data
//! directory `initdb` creates once, and a superuser password that exists only in the OS keyring.
//! [`Recipe::ritual`] and [`first_run`](crate::generate::first_run) are the machinery; this
//! module's share is the two steps.
//!
//! # What was measured rather than assumed
//!
//! Every platform difference below was measured against a real server — `mixengine-packages`'
//! `tools/postgres_smoke.py` runs this sequence on every runner, and `docs/packages/postgres.md`
//! records what it cost:
//!
//! - **`postgres` refuses an elevated Windows token.** `check_root()` asks `pgwin32_is_admin()` and
//!   exits. That is not a database problem and is not solved here: every child MixEngine starts to
//!   run a user's software is created from a restricted token — roadmap task **T34a**, and
//!   `.claude/decisions/0010-supervised-child-never-inherits-administrators.md`.
//! - **`initdb` inherits the machine's locale when it is not told one**, reports *could not find
//!   suitable text search configuration* on a machine whose locale it does not recognise, sets the
//!   default to `simple`, and **exits zero**. Two developers, two databases that answer
//!   differently. Hence the `locale` setting, stated rather than defaulted.
//! - **`initdb` refuses `--auth-*=scram-sha-256` unless it is also given a password**, which is the
//!   `--pwfile` this design exists to avoid. It is asked for `reject` instead — see
//!   the ritual's first step.
//! - **A socket path is capped at 103 characters** and the failure arrives after the server has
//!   started, which reads like a storage problem. `recipes::within_socket_limit`
//!   is what refuses by name instead.
//!
//! # Three generated files, and none of them the ones in the cluster
//!
//! `initdb` writes a `postgresql.conf` and a `pg_hba.conf` **inside the data directory**, and
//! nothing here ever reads, edits or regenerates them: the server is started with `--config-file`
//! pointing at `etc/`, which names the other two and names the data directory. That is the whole
//! reason generated configuration and the data directory can keep opposite policies — the same
//! separation `basedir`/`datadir` gives MariaDB, reached through a different door.
//!
//! # This is the first service with a real reload on all three systems
//!
//! MariaDB has none and cannot have one; php-fpm's is a signal, which Windows answers `unsupported`.
//! `pg_ctl reload` is one shape everywhere, and a running server re-reads both `postgresql.conf` and
//! `pg_hba.conf`. What it does **not** re-read is `shared_buffers`, `port` and `listen_addresses`:
//! those wait for a restart somebody asked for.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! `pg_upgrade` — a cluster bootstrapped by one major cannot be read by the next, and
//! [`READY_MARKER`](crate::generate::first_run::READY_MARKER) already records which one did it. A
//! second instance beside the first (T36). An application role that is not the superuser.
//! Extensions: the artifact ships 46 and `CREATE EXTENSION` is the user's to run;
//! `shared_preload_libraries` stays empty. Backup and restore.
