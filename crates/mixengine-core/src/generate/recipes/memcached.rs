//! Memcached — roadmap task **T35**, with [`redis`](super::redis) the other half of it.
//!
//! # The first recipe that renders nothing
//!
//! `docs/features/services.md` opens with "no hand-written config files", and every recipe before
//! this one answered that by rendering one. **Memcached has no configuration file format at all** —
//! not one it declines to use, one that does not exist: every setting is a command-line flag, and
//! what distributions call `/etc/memcached.conf` is a list of flags their init script pastes onto
//! the command line. So this recipe's [`files`](Recipe::files) is empty, `etc/memcached@main/` is
//! never created, and the typed overrides land in [`ServiceSpec::args`] instead of in a template.
//!
//! That is the honest shape rather than a shortcut. Rendering a file nothing reads, so that the
//! catalogue looks uniform, would put a document in front of the user that changes nothing when they
//! edit it — which is the exact failure the "users edit overrides, never the generated file" rule
//! exists to prevent.
//!
//! # An accept really is readiness here
//!
//! T33 argued at length that a TCP accept is a dishonest readiness check for a database, because it
//! stays true for the whole of InnoDB's crash recovery while the server refuses every query. None of
//! that applies to this program: memcached allocates its slabs and enters its event loop, and there
//! is no recovery phase in which it is listening and unable to answer. The accept is the readiness.
//!
//! It is also all there is. **The package is one file** — `bin/memcached`, and nothing else — so
//! there is no client to ask a question with, the way `redis-cli` and `mariadb-admin` are asked. The
//! end-to-end suite speaks the text protocol over a socket itself, which is the same thing
//! `mixengine-packages` does to smoke-test the artifact.
//!
//! # Stopped by being killed, on purpose
//!
//! [`ADR 0008`] names Memcached as the service where stopping without a signal costs nothing, and
//! the artifact agrees from the other end: it is built **without** `--enable-shutdown`, so the
//! `shutdown` verb does not exist on the wire. That was a packaging decision worth keeping here in
//! words, because the alternative reads like an omission — enabling it would put an unauthenticated
//! `shutdown` on a loopback port that anything served by this machine can reach, to save flushing a
//! cache that has nothing to flush.
//!
