//! php-fpm: the FastCGI pool behind every PHP site — roadmap task **T32**.
//!
//! **The first recipe whose binary does not come from a package.** A PHP is installed with
//! `runtime.install` into `runtime_installs`, and the process that serves its sites lives inside
//! that directory — so this recipe's service row points there, `service.create` refuses to write one
//! by hand, and `runtime.uninstall` is the thing that takes it away.
//!
//! # Two mechanisms, one vocabulary
//!
//! There is **no php-fpm on Windows** and this is upstream's shape rather than an omission of ours:
//! every PHP in `mixengine-packages`' index from 7.0 to 8.5 publishes `php` and `php-fpm` on Linux
//! and macOS, and `php` and `php-cgi` on Windows. What was not obvious, and was measured against the
//! artifact this project publishes rather than read about, is that this costs almost nothing:
//! `php-cgi.exe` given `PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN` **is** a process manager — a master, N children, a child
//! respawned within a second of being killed, recycling at `PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS`, and every child
//! going with the master when it is terminated. That is php-fpm with `pm = static`, configured
//! through the environment instead of through a file.
//!
//! So the two systems differ only in the mechanism, and a user meets one vocabulary:
//!
//! | | Unix | Windows |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | program | `provides["php-fpm"]` | `provides["php-cgi"]` |
//! | workers | `pm.max_children` in the pool file | `PHP_FCGI_CHILDREN` |
//! | recycling | `pm.max_requests` | `PHP_FCGI_MAX_REQUESTS` |
//! | listen | `run/php-fpm-<instance>.sock` | `127.0.0.1:<services.port>` |
//! | reload | `SIGUSR2` | none |
//!
//! Which binary it is comes out of the artifact's own `provides` map rather than being written down
//! here, which is what keeps a `#[cfg]` out of this file: the index says where the executable is,
//! and the recipe asks for it by the name we gave it.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! **No `pm = dynamic` and no `pm = ondemand`.** Windows can express neither, and an override that
//! works on two systems out of three is exactly the divide this task exists to avoid.
//!
//! **No `request_terminate_timeout` on Windows.** A hung script holds a worker there for as long as
//! it hangs, and with five of them that is a dead PHP. The fix needs no process manager — the master
//! respawns a killed child, so the daemon would only have to kill a worker that has run too long —
//! but doing it right needs its own measurement of how a hung script behaves on that system, and
//! that is a task of its own.
//!
//! **No `php.ini` and no `conf.d` of its own.** What a *pool* renders and what a *runtime's* ini set
//! contains are different files with different owners, and this recipe owns the first. What it does
//! do is name the second: `PHP_INI_SCAN_DIR` is set on both arms, so the pool and the `php` on
//! somebody's terminal load one set — see [`crate::runtimes::extensions`], roadmap task T28.
//!
//! **No site, and no `pool.d/` either.** Phase 4 renders the first per-site file and brings both the
//! directory and the `include` that finds it. Naming them here ahead of time was tried and reverted:
//! php-fpm treats a glob whose directory is missing as a hard error rather than as a pattern that
//! matched nothing, and the directory cannot be there for the first `--test` — `include` names the
//! *installed* path while validation runs over the *staged* one, before anything is installed. The
//! file says so where the line used to be.
//!
//! # A pool of an extension's own — roadmap task **T82a**
//!
//! Since that task a `web-app` extension is served on `php-fpm@<extension-id>`, a second pool on the
//! same installed PHP as the shared `php-fpm@<version>`. Three things in this file follow from it:
//! the socket is named after the *instance* rather than the version, so two pools of one PHP do not
//! collide; a pool may carry an `EnvValue::Keyring` its site signs in with, and an edge to the
//! database that credential opens; and the pool file renders `clear_env = no` for that pool alone,
//! because php-fpm hands a worker nothing otherwise and the only alternative would write a password
//! into a generated file. `with_credential` in this file is where the second and third meet.
//!
//! **A `pm.status_path` since T72a, and still no slowlog.** The status page is what tells the daemon
//! whether anybody is using a pool it cannot count connections to — see `STATUS_PATH` and
//! [`Recipe::idle_probe`]. It is rendered on both systems and read on one: `php-cgi.exe` ignores the
//! directive because it never reads this file at all, and Windows counts a real port instead. The
//! slowlog stays absent, because nothing reads it.
