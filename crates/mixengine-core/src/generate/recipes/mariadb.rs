//! MariaDB: the database MixEngine runs for a site — roadmap task **T33**.
//!
//! **The first recipe with something to do before it can ever start.** Caddy and php-fpm are a
//! rendered file and a command line; a database is a rendered file, a command line, *and* a data
//! directory that has to be created once by a different program, with a root password that must
//! exist nowhere on disk. The second half is [`Recipe::ritual`] and
//! [`first_run`](crate::generate::first_run); this module's own share of it is the steps.
//!
//! # What was measured rather than assumed
//!
//! Every platform difference below comes out of T33a, which ran a real server on all three systems
//! rather than reading about one:
//!
//! - **`mariadb-install-db` is two different programs.** A shell script on Unix, a C++ program of
//!   the same name on Windows, sharing almost no options —
//!   `--auth-root-authentication-method=normal` is Unix-only and the Windows build answers `unknown
//!   variable` and exits 7.
//! - **Upstream's script does not quote `$basedir`**, so a path with a space in it is split into two
//!   arguments and the script stops with "Could not find my_print_defaults". A user called
//!   `Nguyen Hai Quang` is not an edge case.
//! - **`sockaddr_un` caps a socket path at 103 characters** and the server aborts *after* InnoDB has
//!   started, which reads like a storage failure and is not one.
//! - **Windows `mariadbd` writes only to `<datadir>/<hostname>.err`** and sends nothing to stdout,
//!   so a supervisor reading the process's own output finds an empty file.
//! - **MariaDB's option parser treats `\` as an escape** and everything after an unquoted `#` as a
//!   comment, which is why every path in the rendered file is quoted and forward-slashed.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! **No reload.** MariaDB reads its configuration once, at startup. A changed override takes effect
//! when somebody restarts the service, and the daemon does not restart what nobody asked it to.
//!
//! **No `unix_socket` authentication.** Root is created with a password, which is the one
//! arrangement that means the same thing on all three systems — and the credential lives in the OS
//! keyring, never in the rendered file (ADR 0006).
//!
//! **No `mariadb-upgrade`.** Running a data directory bootstrapped by one version against a later
//! one is a task of its own; what is recorded here is the version that performed the bootstrap, in
//! [`READY_MARKER`](crate::generate::first_run::READY_MARKER), so that task has something to read.
