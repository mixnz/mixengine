//! MySQL: the other database with these programs' names — roadmap task **T34c**.
//!
//! **Not a version of [`mariadb`](super::mariadb)**, and anybody maintaining an application against
//! one of them can say which. It is its own package, its own recipe and its own rows — and the two
//! of them name the same port, which is the whole reason a port is allocated when a row is written
//! rather than taken from a recipe at start ([`crate::services::ports`]).
//!
//! # What was measured rather than assumed
//!
//! Every route below was run against a real server — 8.4.10 and 5.6.51 while this was written, and
//! every published cell by `mixengine-packages`' own `mysql_smoke.py` before the artifact was
//! allowed out:
//!
//! - **There is no `--bootstrap` after 5.7.6.** MariaDB sets its root password through a server that
//!   reads SQL on standard input; MySQL removed that mode, so the statement goes into a file the
//!   daemon writes and removes around one step — see
//!   [`SecretFile`].
//! - **`--initialize-insecure` creates exactly one account, `root@localhost`.** MariaDB's installer
//!   creates `root@127.0.0.1` as well, which is what makes its `skip-name-resolve` safe; copying
//!   that line into this template would leave every client refused by a server whose own log says it
//!   is ready for connections. So this configuration does not set it, and the template says why.
//! - **A modern MySQL opens a second listener nobody asked for**: the X Protocol, on 33060, which no
//!   allocation ever handed out and no `services` row records. `loose-mysqlx = OFF` switches it off
//!   on 8.0 and newer and is a warning rather than a refusal on 5.6 and 5.7, where the option does
//!   not exist — one line instead of a version branch inside a template.
//! - **Bootstrapping is a table of three routes and not a version test** — see `Route`. 5.6
//!   answers differently on Windows than on Unix, and its Unix installer is *Perl* in a tree
//!   compiled from source, so what runs it is read off its own first line.
//! - **5.7's Windows binary refuses `--skip-networking` alone.** It aborts a `--skip-networking`
//!   start with `TCP/IP, --shared-memory, or --named-pipe should be configured on NT OS` — after
//!   running the `--init-file` that sets the password, so the account is left with its new password
//!   on a server that then fails to come up. Measured against 5.7.44; 8.0.44 has no such check, so
//!   the extra flag is added only where the version and the OS both call for it.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! **No reload**, for MariaDB's reason: the configuration is read once, at startup.
//!
//! **No authentication-plugin default.** 8.0 wants `default_authentication_plugin`, 8.4 removed that
//! variable and disabled `mysql_native_password` altogether, and 5.6 knows neither. A line that
//! makes an old client work on one release refuses to start on another, and this recipe is found by
//! package name and runs whichever of five lines a user installed. The day a client needs it, it is
//! an override on one instance rather than a default for all of them.
//!
//! **No `mysql_upgrade`.** Running a data directory bootstrapped by one version against a later one
//! is a task of its own; what is recorded is the version that performed the bootstrap, in
//! [`READY_MARKER`](crate::generate::first_run::READY_MARKER).
