//! Nginx: the alternative front end — roadmap task **T37**.
//!
//! The second of the two programs `.claude/features/services.md` will let a site be reached through,
//! and the one that makes "exactly one active front end" a rule somebody can break — which is why
//! [`Role`] arrived with it. Everything else here is [`caddy`](super::caddy)'s shape answered by a
//! server that has none of Caddy's mechanisms:
//!
//! - **There is no admin endpoint, so the recipe renders one.** A loopback `server` block that
//!   answers `200` on `/mixengine/health` and `404` on everything else is both the readiness check
//!   and the health probe. The obvious alternative — a TCP connect on the port — is not a weaker
//!   version of that, it is a different question: the master process holds the listening socket, so
//!   a connection is accepted in exactly the same way when every worker has died. A request that
//!   comes back is one a worker reading this configuration served.
//! - **`nginx -t` judges the rendering before it is installed**, over the staging directory T30
//!   builds, exactly as `caddy validate` does. What makes the two of them work differently is where
//!   an `include` resolves: Caddy's `import` is relative to the file, nginx's is relative to the
//!   **prefix** — so `-p` is passed in both places, pointing at the staging directory while the
//!   configuration is being judged and at `etc/<service-id>/` once it is installed.
//! - **A changed rendering is reloaded rather than restarted**, through `-s reload` against the
//!   running master. That is a signal in nginx's own spelling rather than an OS one, so it works on
//!   Windows, where the supervisor's own `signal` does not — and it is why the pid file goes where
//!   this configuration says rather than where nginx would compile it: `-s` finds a master through
//!   the configuration it is given.
//!
//! # Judged against the real server
//!
//! `crates/mixengine-cli/tests/nginx.rs` runs the whole of that against a real nginx, and it runs it
//! through the same harness [`caddy`](super::caddy)'s suite does — which is the parity half of T37.
//! Two findings are in the template beside the lines they explain: forward-slashed quoted paths, and
//! five temp directories that are children of one that exists.
//!
//! # What this recipe deliberately does not do
//!
//! **It renders no site, and listens on nothing a site would be reached on.** `include sites/*.conf`
//! matches nothing until Phase 4 (T39, T43), and the row's own port is written into no `listen` at
//! all: binding 80 needs the port grant T42 has not built on macOS and Linux, and a front end
//! holding a port it serves nothing on is worse than one that has not taken it yet. Caddy says the
//! same thing by writing `http_port` into a global block and binding neither.
//!
//! **It terminates no TLS.** Phase 5 owns the certificate, and a `listen ... ssl` with no
//! certificate is a configuration nginx refuses outright rather than one it starts without.
//!
