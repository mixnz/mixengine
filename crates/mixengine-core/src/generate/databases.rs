//! How a package administers its databases: what to ask, and what to run — roadmap task **T77a**.
//!
//! **The recipe declares, the daemon performs** — T33's division, one table across (the T77a design,
//! D1). A recipe lives here, in a crate with no business reaching an OS credential store and no
//! business spawning anything, so what it answers is *which statements*; the daemon answers *with
//! which credential, against which running server*.
//!
//! # The probe, and why its output is two words
//!
//! The daemon has to know which of the two objects already exist before it can decide anything, and
//! the obvious shape — each recipe emitting its own output and the daemon parsing it — would put
//! MariaDB's result format in the daemon and undo D1. So each engine's query is written to print the
//! word `database` on a line if the database is there, and `user` on a line if the account is. Three
//! queries, one [`Found::read`].
//!
//! # Validated, never escaped
//!
//! Every statement quotes its identifiers and nothing escapes them, which is safe for exactly one
//! reason: [`validated_identifier`] refuses every character that could end a quoted identifier. There
//! is no escaping function in this crate to get wrong, and nothing reaches a statement that it did
//! not accept.
