//! What a user may change about a generated file, and what happens when they misspell it.
//!
//! A user never edits `etc/**` — the file is a projection of the database and the next start
//! overwrites it. What they edit is an **override**, stored in `services.config_overrides_json` and
//! merged over the recipe's defaults on the way into the template. This module is that merge.
//!
//! **Typed, and closed.** A recipe declares every key it understands as a [`Setting`] with a default
//! that fixes its type, and an override naming a key that is not in that list is *refused* rather
//! than ignored. The rule is `config.toml`'s ([`crate::Error::Config`]) one directory down and for
//! the same reason: a silently dropped `max_connectons` is a setting the user believes is in effect,
//! and they find out when the database falls over under load rather than when they typed it.
//!
//! **One key belongs to no recipe**, and every service has it: [`EXTRA`] is the free-form blob
//! `docs/features/services.md` promises — the directives MixEngine has no opinion about, pasted
//! into the generated file verbatim. It is deliberately not a [`Setting`], because a recipe cannot
//! choose whether to offer it: a config format this build models incompletely is the normal case,
//! and a user who cannot add a line to it is a user editing the generated file by hand.
