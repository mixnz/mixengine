//! Which home this is — roadmap task **T126**.
//!
//! The OS credential store is one store per *user*, not one per home, and `MIXENGINE_HOME` means a
//! user can have several: a sandbox for a real run, a suite's temporary home, a second install for
//! a different set of projects. Until this module a secret's address said only which service it
//! belonged to, so all of those wrote to one entry and the last one to bootstrap won — leaving
//! every earlier home with a server whose password it could no longer produce.
//!
//! So a home carries an identity, and [`services::handoff::secret_key`](crate::services::handoff::secret_key)
//! puts it in front of every address. What that identity is, and why it is not derived from the
//! path, is argued in `migrations/0021_home_id.sql` and in
//! [ADR 0032](https://github.com/mixnz/mixlab/blob/master/docs/decisions/0032-a-keyring-address-names-the-home-it-belongs-to.md).
