//! Unpacking a downloaded artifact, without letting it choose where its bytes land.
//!
//! # The entry path is checked here, not only by the crate that writes it
//!
//! Both `tar` and `zip` already refuse to write outside the directory they are handed —
//! `Entry::unpack_in` returns `false` and `ZipFile::enclosed_name` returns [`None`]. This module
//! checks the path itself anyway, *before* either is asked to write, for two reasons that are not
//! the same reason. The refusal becomes ours, so it has a message naming the entry and a test that
//! holds it; and the check stops being a property of whichever crate version is resolved this week,
//! for what is the single most attacked step in installing anything.
//!
//! What is deliberately **not** re-implemented here is everything below the path: the mode bits, the
//! symlinks, the hardlinks. Those are the operating system's business, `.claude/standards/rust.md`
//! says a `#[cfg]` outside `mixengine-platform` fails review, and a hand-rolled unpacker would need
//! one per entry type. Delegating that to the crate whose job it is *is* the platform abstraction
//! here.
//!
//! # Why the format comes from the URL
//!
//! The URL is a field of a document this build has already verified an Ed25519 signature over, so
//! its suffix is as trustworthy as the SHA-256 beside it — and it is the same key
//! `tools/mkindex.py` writes the index from. Sniffing magic bytes instead would read a claim made by
//! the downloaded file about itself, which is a strictly weaker statement than one we signed.
