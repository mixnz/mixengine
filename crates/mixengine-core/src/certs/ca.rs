//! The internal certificate authority: making one, reading one, and refusing to replace one.
//!
//! **A certificate cannot carry a hash of itself**, which is what
//! `docs/architecture/security-model.md` asks for when it names the subject
//! `MixEngine Local CA <short-fingerprint>`: the subject is inside the bytes the fingerprint is
//! over, so no ordering produces it. The eight characters in the name come from the **public key**
//! instead — computable the moment the key pair exists, and stable across re-signing the same key,
//! which is what makes two certificates for one authority recognisable as one authority. What
//! `cert.ca_status` reports as the *fingerprint* is still the hash of the certificate, because that
//! is the number a browser shows and therefore the only one a person can compare against anything.
//!
//! **Damage is reported here and never repaired.** Regenerating on finding a broken authority would
//! invalidate every leaf already issued and every trust store the old certificate reached, in answer
//! to a request nobody made. Rotation is roadmap task T54, and it exists because it has the steps
//! this would skip: reissue the leaves, then remove the old certificate from the stores.
