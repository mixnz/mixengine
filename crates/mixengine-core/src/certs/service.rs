//! The leaf a managed server presents — roadmap task **T99**.
//!
//! One certificate per service that asks for one, signed by this home's authority, under
//! `certs/services/<service-id>.{key,crt}`. It exists because of one measurement: from 11.4 MariaDB
//! turns TLS on by default, and a server with no certificate configured *generates one at every
//! start* — a 4096-bit RSA key, four to thirteen seconds of silence on a CI runner, the whole of
//! the M3 warm start's spread. Turning TLS off is not an answer, because an 11.4 client with a
//! password on its command line insists on it and is refused by a server without it. A pair on disk
//! costs the server two file reads. The design is
//! `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-t99-a-certificate-for-the-database-design.md`.
//!
//! **Shaped like [`super::leaf`] on purpose, and made of it.** The same four exports, the same
//! four questions before a pair is reused, the same order of writes — because the body *is*
//! [`super::leaf`]'s, behind a second pair of paths. A site's leaf is named by its primary domain
//! and covers the site's domains; a service's is named by its id and covers `localhost` and the
//! address it binds. Ninety days and a thirty-day renewal window are the site leaf's numbers,
//! deliberately: a second lifetime would be a second rule to keep in step, and a database restarted
//! less than once a quarter is not the laptop this product is for.
//!
//! **Renewed at a start, never reloaded.** MariaDB reads its certificate once; a pair reissued under
//! a running server is served at the next `mix service restart`, and nothing here pretends
//! otherwise.
