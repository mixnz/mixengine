//! Putting a release on this machine — roadmap task **T88**, the design's D3, D8 and D11.
//!
//! # Two halves, and only the second one is new
//!
//! **Staging is an install**, and [`crate::install::Installer`] is the code that does installs here.
//! The feed's artifact *is* an [`Artifact`], which is what makes that literally true rather than
//! nearly: the resumable `.part` file, the SHA-256 the signed document carries, the archive entry
//! that would escape its root, the `provides` the payload promised, and the staged `mixengined` run
//! before anything is replaced — all of it is already written, already tested, and already the code
//! path every runtime this product installs goes through. So [`stage`] is a call and not an
//! implementation.
//!
//! **The swap is the part an install never has to do**, because an install writes somewhere nothing
//! is running from. This one replaces the binaries of the process performing it, which is why it is
//! rename-then-write and why it undoes itself.
//!
//! # What is never swapped
//!
//! `mixengine-elevate`. It is installed once to a root-owned location, and replacing it needs its
//! own elevation prompt with a minisign check performed *inside* the elevated context — roadmap task
//! **T88a**. `.claude/features/updates.md` calls this the single most important rule on the page: an
//! auto-updated binary that runs as root, with no OS signature, is a local privilege-escalation
//! vector. Here it is one name in one constant, [`KEPT`], and a test that a payload containing the
//! helper does not get to replace it.
