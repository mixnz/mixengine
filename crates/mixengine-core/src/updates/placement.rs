//! Whether this copy of MixEngine may replace itself — roadmap task **T88**, the design's D7.
//!
//! **A write probe and not a path table.** A list of "system" prefixes would be per-OS knowledge in
//! this crate, which `CLAUDE.md` forbids, and would be wrong for anybody who installed somewhere
//! unusual. Asking the actual machine covers the four ways of installing that must be refused
//! without a stack trace — `/usr/bin` from a `.deb` or an `.rpm`, `/usr/local/bin` from a `.pkg`,
//! and a read-only AppImage mount — and costs one file created and removed.
//!
//! **Nothing here ever elevates, and nothing here ever will.** An updater that could ask for root
//! would be the local privilege-escalation path this whole feature is written to avoid —
//! `docs/features/updates.md`, and [ADR 0005](../../../../docs/decisions/0005-on-demand-elevation.md).
