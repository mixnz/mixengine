//! What a release says about itself — roadmap task **T88**.
//!
//! **A third [`Document`](crate::index::Document) and not a second client.** The three properties an
//! update feed needs are the three [`crate::index::Client`] already does and already has tests for:
//! the signature is checked before the bytes are parsed, so a JSON parser never runs on unverified
//! input; the cache is re-verified on every read, because a file in the user's home is a file any
//! local process can rewrite; and a correctly signed document from before the one we hold is
//! refused. That last one is the attack that matters here — somebody who can answer the URL replays
//! yesterday's feed to keep a machine on a version with a known hole — and getting it for free is
//! the whole argument for the shape of this module.
//!
//! Nothing here is `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]`, on [`crate::index::format`]'s rule and for its
//! reason: this document is written by us and read by builds older than it, so a release that adds
//! a field must stay readable by every copy already installed.
