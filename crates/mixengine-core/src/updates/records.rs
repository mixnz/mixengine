//! What this home remembers about updates — roadmap task **T88**, the design's D10.
//!
//! Four rows in `settings`, which has been `(key TEXT PRIMARY KEY, value_json TEXT NOT NULL) STRICT`
//! since `0001_initial.sql` and has never had a row in it. This is its first user, and it needs no
//! migration.
//!
//! | Key | Value | Written by | Read by |
//! | --- | --- | --- | --- |
//! | [`SKIPPED_VERSION`] | `"0.2.0"` | `update.decide`, and the post-restart check | the offer decision |
//! | [`REMIND_AFTER`] | a moment | `update.decide` | the offer decision |
//! | [`APPLIED`] | [`Applied`] | the apply, before the swap | the new daemon at start |
//! | [`RESTORE`] | the services that were running | the apply, before the swap | the new daemon at start |
//!
//! **Every record is deleted before it is acted on**, and that is not a tidiness rule. A
//! [`RESTORE`] that survived being read would be replayed by every later start — so a person who
//! updates, stops MariaDB because they are done with it, and reboots gets MariaDB back, for ever,
//! with nothing in the product able to tell them why. Deleted *before* rather than after, so that a
//! start which dies half way through the restore does not make the record immortal either: the cost
//! of this order is one lost restore on a daemon that crashed mid-start, and the cost of the other
//! is a home that can never stop a service again.
//!
//! **A row this build cannot read is [`None`] and not an error.** A record whose JSON no longer
//! parses means the same thing to every caller here as one that was never written — go and ask
//! again — and failing a daemon start over a skipped version would be absurd.
