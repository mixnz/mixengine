//! Putting a replacement `mixengine-elevate` where the elevation prompt will find it — roadmap task
//! **T88a**.
//!
//! **Nothing here installs anything**, and the module is written so that reading it makes that
//! obvious: it fetches two files, checks one against the other, and writes them into
//! `<home>/run/helper/`. What turns them into the file this machine runs as root is
//! [`PrivilegedOp::HelperReplace`](mixengine_proto::privileged::PrivilegedOp::HelperReplace),
//! applied by the *installed* helper behind an explicit prompt, which checks the same signature
//! again against a key of its own.
//!
//! **So why check it twice?** The second check is the security boundary — this process runs as the
//! user and is, if it has been compromised, the attacker. The first one is the user interface:
//! `docs/features/updates.md` asks that a tampered artifact be refused *with the reason shown*,
//! and a reason that only appears after somebody has clicked Allow is not shown. See the T88a
//! design, D13.
//!
//! **And why a detached signature rather than the SHA-256 inside the signed feed**, which is how
//! every other artifact this product installs is bound? Because the process that has to be
//! convinced never fetched the feed and must not trust the daemon that did. `docs/features/`
//! `updates.md` states that exception in the same paragraph that states the rule.
