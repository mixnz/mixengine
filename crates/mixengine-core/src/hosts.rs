/// **`wired` is per TLD, and that is a correction to T44** — the T45 design, D6. T44 gave this home
/// one `DnsMode` and computed the whole block from it: hosts-only meant a line per domain, DNS meant
/// an empty block. That was right while nothing could be wired, because both terms were false for
/// every TLD at once. It stops being right the moment a resolver is pointed anywhere, because every
/// mechanism there is scopes to **one TLD** — a file per TLD on macOS, a namespace per rule on
/// Windows, an entry in `Domains=` on Linux — and `.local` is deliberately never wired at all. A
/// home holding both `blog.test` and `shop.local` needs a block with exactly one line in it, and it
/// is the `.local` one.
