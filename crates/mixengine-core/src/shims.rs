//! Which commands `<root>/bin` fronts, and what each one runs.
//!
//! A shim is one binary, copied once per name it answers to, that reads its own file name to find
//! out which command was invoked ([runtime-versions.md](../../../.claude/features/runtime-versions.md)).
//! This module is the table that name is looked up in, and it is here rather than in the shim binary
//! for the reason every table like it is in `core`: the process that *fills* `<root>/bin` needs the
//! same list, and two lists would be a `bin/` holding a name nothing dispatches — a program that
//! exists, runs, and refuses to be anything.
//!
//! # A command and an executable are two different names
//!
//! [`Command::name`] is what the user types and what the file in `bin/` is called. `executable` is
//! the key of the artifact's `provides` map, which is **ours rather than the publisher's** — the
//! path inside the archive belongs to whoever packed it, the name it is published under is a
//! convention this project sets, and the index is written to match. That is what lets `python3` and
//! `python` be one program, and `bundler` and `bundle` be one program, without the shim caring which
//! of them a given archive happened to call its file.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not in the table
//!
//! Every tool that is neither inside a language's archive nor published as an artifact of its own.
//! **`composer` used to be the example** — a `.phar` fetched separately, so a row would have been a
//! shim that resolved a PHP correctly and then failed to find a file no artifact contained. T27c
//! made it an artifact of its own kind, and its row is the one with a [`Command::via`]: the kind
//! names the file, `via` names the program that runs it.
//!
//! **Only PHP has artifacts today** (T20a), so the other three rows are unexercised until T27
//! publishes theirs. They are written now because the table is what a shim dispatches on: a row
//! missing when the artifact lands is a `node` in `bin/` that says it is nobody's, and the failure a
//! wrong row produces is one sentence naming what the runtime *does* publish, which is the same
//! sentence a missing row would need anyway.
//!
//! # Filling `bin/` — roadmap task T26
//!
//! [`refresh`] is the other half of the table's reason for being here: one copy of the shim binary
//! per row, under the row's name. It is what turns T25's binary into commands a person can type.
//!
//! **`bin/` is entirely MixEngine's**, which is what lets a refresh remove what it does not
//! recognise. `.claude/architecture/overview.md` describes the directory as "version-resolving
//! shims" and nothing else, so a file in there answering to no command is a command that was
//! renamed or dropped between releases — a program that exists, runs, and refuses to be anything.
//! Somebody who wants a script of their own on the PATH has every other directory on the machine to
//! put it in.
//!
//! **It does not depend on what is installed.** [`COMMANDS`] is a constant, so `bin/` holds `node`
//! on a machine with no Node.js: the shim there resolves nothing and says which command to type,
//! which is a better answer than `node: command not found` for a tool whose whole job is managing
//! versions of Node. That is also why nothing calls this after an install —
//! [runtime-versions.md](../../../.claude/features/runtime-versions.md) lists "refresh shims" as the
//! last step of one, and there is nothing to refresh.
