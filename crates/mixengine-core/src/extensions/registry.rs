//! The published list of extensions, and the reading of it — roadmap task **T81**.
//!
//! # A second document, and the key that already exists
//!
//! `extensions.json` is published beside `index.json`, under the same moved tag, and signed with
//! **[`crate::index::PUBLIC_KEY`]** — no third key. The precedent that might argue for one is the
//! blueprint gallery, which took a key of its own because its blast radius differed: one compromise
//! of the index key costs the package index, one compromise of a key that vouches for a
//! `[scaffold]` costs the right to run arbitrary code on every machine that took a blueprint in.
//! **An extension has the package index's blast radius exactly** — a binary downloaded and
//! supervised — so a separate key would separate nothing, and would add a third constant to rotate,
//! a third Actions secret, and a third half-finished rotation to get wrong.
//!
//! # Two documents rather than one array added to the index
//!
//! Failure isolation rather than tidiness. An entry this build cannot read has to be skipped
//! ([`Registry::listing`]); inside a document that also holds every runtime, the code that skips
//! would have to be exactly right or `mix runtime list` dies of an extension. Two documents make
//! that structural: no reading of this one can fail the reading of that one, because they are not
//! the same read.
//!
//! # An entry *is* a manifest
//!
//! Not a pointer to one. [`manifest::ExtensionManifest`] already carries `[artifact.<target>]` with
//! its URL and hash, so a manifest is the entry a downloader needs — and because permissions arrive
//! with the listing, the question *"this wants to reach the LAN and read your project roots — go
//! on?"* can be asked **before a single artifact byte is fetched**. Asking afterwards is asking
//! after doing the thing somebody was about to refuse.
//!
//! Nothing here fetches an artifact or writes a row: this module answers *what exists*.
