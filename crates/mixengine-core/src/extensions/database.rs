//! Which database a `web-app` extension is pointed at — roadmap task **T82**, the design's D4.
//!
//! **Resolved the way T81b resolves the PHP**: at install, before anything is fetched, refused by
//! name when nothing satisfies it, and frozen into a row rather than recomputed. The row is
//! `site_service_links`, which T81b left empty for an extension site and named this task to fill.
//!
//! # Writing the link is what arms the refusal
//!
//! Nothing here adds a check to `service.delete`, and the first draft of this design added one
//! before noticing why it should not. [`sites::declaring`](crate::sites::declaring) reads
//! `WHERE s.php_service_id = ? OR l.service_id = ?` — a *link* counts — so deleting the database an
//! extension administers is already refused, naming the site, and crossable only with `--force`.
//! Writing the row buys the refusal, and a second one would be a second thing to keep in step.
//!
//! What `--force` then leaves behind is a `web-app` whose declared engines resolve to nothing.
//! [`config`](super::config) answers that with a skip and a warning rather than by rewriting a
//! configuration to point nowhere: see its own note.
//!
//! # No password here, and no socket
//!
//! [`Endpoint`] carries a host, a port and an account name. It carries no credential, because the
//! design's D6 says a generated file does not hold one — where the password lives stays
//! [`Context::secret_address`](crate::generate::recipe::Context::secret_address)'s answer, in the
//! keyring. It carries no socket, because every database recipe binds a TCP port on all three
//! systems (T34c), so one address form is enough and a placeholder that rendered to nothing on
//! Windows would be a template nobody could write once.
