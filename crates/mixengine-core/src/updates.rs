//! What signs a MixEngine release — roadmap task **T86**.
//!
//! This module is one constant today, and the constant is the whole point: it is the root of trust
//! for everything the updater will later install. T88 grows the module into the client that reads
//! `latest.json`; what is here is the key that document will be checked against.
//!
//! # A third key, and one key for every artifact
//!
//! [`crate::index::PUBLIC_KEY`] signs the package index and [`crate::blueprints::trust::PUBLIC_KEY`]
//! signs the blueprint gallery. Both are used from `mixnz/mixengine-packages`, by that repository's
//! workflows, with that repository's secrets. A compromise there would cost the index and the
//! gallery; it must not additionally hand somebody the right to sign the `mixengined` a machine runs
//! as itself. Different repository, different workflow, different secret — so, a different key.
//!
//! The same key signs **every** artifact in a release, `mixengine-elevate` included. A key of its
//! own for the one binary that runs as root would be the same secret in the same place under a
//! second name: it splits the label and not the blast radius. What protects the helper is that it is
//! never auto-updated and that its replacement is verified inside the elevated context (T88a).
//!
//! # No verifier here
//!
//! There is deliberately no `verify` function. T88 checks `latest.json` through
//! [`crate::index::Client`], which already verifies before it parses, and checks the payload against
//! the SHA-256 that signed document carries. T88a checks the helper inside the elevated context, and
//! `mixengine-elevate` may not depend on this crate at all — `workspace_layering.rs` says so — so
//! that copy of the key will live in the helper. A verifier here would have exactly one caller: a
//! test of itself.
//!
//! # Rotating it
//!
//! Rotating this key is a one-way door. Every installed copy trusts exactly one key, so a build from
//! before a rotation can never verify a feed signed after it — silently, since T88's client keeps
//! the last document it verified and logs a refusal nobody reads. See
//! [updates.md](../../../.claude/features/updates.md) for what a rotation therefore costs and for
//! the shape of the mitigation nobody has needed yet.
