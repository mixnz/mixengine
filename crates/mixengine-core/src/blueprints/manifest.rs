//! `[php]` and `[scaffold]`.
//!
//! **Its own type rather than `mixengine.toml`'s** — the T77 design, D1. The two files overlap but
//! are not one: a blueprint carries `domain_pattern` where a project manifest carries `domain` and
//! `aliases`, and it carries `database` and `user`, which the project manifest does not interpret.
//! They also have two lifetimes. `mixengine.toml` is written by a person, lives in their repository
//! under their comments and is edited byte-preservingly by [`crate::manifest::write`]; a blueprint
//! is generated, read once and thrown away. One struct serving both would make every key an
//! `Option` and hand the comment-preserving writer a second file shape to preserve.
//!
//! **There is no `[php] ini`** (D2). Every ini value MixEngine writes is a constant in
//! [`crate::runtimes::extensions`] — the same `memory_limit = 512M` on every machine this product
//! runs on — so there is no deviation to capture, and capturing it would be capturing a global
//! default, which is the one thing this task is defined against. The key arrives with the task that
//! gives a project an ini of its own.
