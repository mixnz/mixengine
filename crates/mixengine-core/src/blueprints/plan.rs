//! What applying a blueprint would do, decided before anything happens.
//!
//! Roadmap task **T77**; **T78** is what carries the result out.
//!
//! # One place decides, and the order is part of the answer
//!
//! The feature's acceptance criterion is that `--dry-run` matches exactly what the real run
//! performs. That is only enforceable while one function decides what the actions are, so this is
//! it: T78's executor consumes the list and may **fail**, but may not add a step, drop one or
//! reorder them. The order here is dependency order — project, runtimes, services, databases, site,
//! domains, certificate, extensions, scaffold — and is asserted by a test rather than left to the
//! shape of the code.
//!
//! What is deliberately *not* in a plan is anything only the execution can know: the port a new
//! instance lands on, a generated password, a rowid. A plan that named them would be a plan the
//! executor has to contradict.
//!
//! # It reads this home's tables, and nothing else
//!
//! **No index, no network** (D9). The mismatch prompt in the feature doc shows a download size, and
//! a size means asking the index, and the index has a network behind a six-hour cache — while this
//! is the command a person runs *because* they do not want anything to happen yet. So a version
//! nothing installed satisfies is `create`, without a size, and whether the index still publishes it
//! is discovered by the real run.
//!
//! # Everything that cannot be done is decided here
//!
//! **D10.** The point of a plan is that an apply does not get five actions into a project directory
//! before discovering that the sixth was impossible — so a name that is too long, a directory that
//! is already another project's, and a domain another site owns are all `blocked` at this point,
//! each naming what stands in the way.
