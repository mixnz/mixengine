//! The `bin_commands` table: tools somebody installed into a runtime — roadmap task **T131**.
//!
//! This module owns every read and write of that table, on [`crate::packages`]' rule. What it holds
//! is a **projection**: [`record`] replaces it whole, the way `etc/` is rebuilt from the database
//! rather than patched, so a row never outlives the file it describes by more than one scan.
//!
//! # Two readers, one row each
//!
//! The daemon reads [`all`] to compose `<root>/bin`, and a shim reads [`kind`] — one query, one
//! answer — to find out which language's version resolution decides which copy of `yarn` it is
//! about to become. That is the whole reason the table exists: a shim is handed only the name it
//! was invoked by, and deriving the language from that would mean listing the global directory of
//! every installed runtime before running any command at all.
//!
//! # What it deliberately does not hold
//!
//! **Where the file is.** A global tool belongs to *a version*, not to an install — `yarn` under
//! Node 24 is not `yarn` under Node 22 — so the path is resolved at run time, against whichever
//! version the working directory means, and a recorded path would be the wrong one the moment
//! somebody `cd`s into a project that pins another Node. What is recorded is the one fact that does
//! not vary that way: which language it belongs to.
