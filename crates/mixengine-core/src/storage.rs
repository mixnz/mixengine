//! Whether the directories that grow may still be moved — roadmap task **T143**.
//!
//! **The location of a runtime is not a lookup, it is a row.** `runtime_installs.install_path` and
//! `services.data_dir` are `TEXT` columns holding absolute paths, written when the install happened
//! and read forever after. So `[paths]` is free to change for exactly as long as no row names a
//! path, and after that changing it is a file move and a rewrite of those rows — which this module
//! does not do and does not pretend to.
//!
//! **Three counts and no walk of the disk.** A directory that has files in it says nothing: a
//! `runtimes/` somebody copied there by hand is not an install, and an empty `data/` beside a
//! service row is a service whose data directory is about to be recreated. The rows are what record
//! a path, so the rows are what close the window.
//!
//! `logs/` is deliberately not consulted. Nothing records where a log line went, so relocating
//! `logs/` breaks nothing that already exists — it leaves the old `daemon.log` where it was, which
//! is a sentence for a person rather than a reason to refuse.
