//! **One answer per operating system, read by both sides of the privilege boundary.** The daemon
//! reads it to decide which file to hand the elevation prompt; `mixengine-elevate` reads the same
//! function to decide where to put itself. Two answers to that question would be a helper installed
//! somewhere nothing ever looks — so there is one, and it is here.
//!
//! Nothing in this module creates anything or checks anything: it says *where*, and
//! `mixengine-elevate` is the only thing that ever writes there. Who owns what is already
//! [`crate::elevated::owner_of`]'s question, and the answer to it is what
