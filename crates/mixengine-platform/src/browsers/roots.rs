//! Where the NSS databases are, on a machine that has any.
//!
//! **Six roots where `docs/features/tls.md` names two, and the three extra ones are the
//! measurement this task started from** — the T49b design, D3. On Ubuntu 22.04 and later the
//! `firefox` deb is a transitional package to the snap, whose profiles live under `~/snap`, so a
//! faithful implementation of that table finds nothing on the distribution most people run and
//! reports success.
//!
//! **The list is generous on purpose.** A root that matches nothing costs a `read_dir` that returns
//! `ENOENT`; a root that is missing costs a user a red padlock with no diagnostic, in the browser
//! they actually use. The asymmetry is the whole argument.
