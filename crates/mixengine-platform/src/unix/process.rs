//! `setsid` between the fork and the exec, for both kinds of child.
//!
//! Surviving the parent needs nothing on Unix — an orphan is reparented to init and carries on. What
//! does need arranging is the *session*: a child inherits its parent's process group, and a terminal
//! sends `SIGINT` to the whole foreground group, so a daemon that stayed in it would die the next
//! time somebody pressed Ctrl-C in the window it was started from. `setsid` puts it in a new session
//! with no controlling terminal at all, which is the difference between a background process and a
//! detached one.
//!
//! # The same call, for the opposite reason
//!
//! A *supervised* child gets `setsid` too, and it is worth being clear that this buys something
//! narrower than the Windows counterpart. `setsid` makes the child a session and process-group
//! leader with `pgid == pid`, and its own children inherit that group — so one `kill` to `-pgid`
//! reaches a php-fpm master and every worker it forked, which is what stopping a service has to
//! mean. What it does **not** do is notice that the daemon has died: a session is a grouping, not a
//! lifetime, and a killed daemon leaves the whole group running. Linux answers that with
//! `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` in `linux/process.rs`, which is why arranging a supervised spawn is the one
//! thing in this file the two systems do not share; macOS has no answer and says so.
//! `.claude/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` is where the three-way
