//! Windows: Smart App Control's own policy value — roadmap task **T94**.
//!
//! **The registry rather than `Get-MpComputerStatus`** (T94 design, D1).
//! `docs/architecture/platform-abstraction.md` rule 5 asks for the API where there is one, and
//! the alternative here is not an API — it is spawning PowerShell and parsing a localised object.
//! And this value is the one with evidence at both ends of its range: it read `1` on a developer
//! machine with Smart App Control enforcing on 2026-08-13, and `0` on the same machine on
//! 2026-09-04 after it had been turned off, with `SAC_PreviousState = 1` beside it.
