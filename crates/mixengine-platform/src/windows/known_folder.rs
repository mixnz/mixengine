//! A system directory asked of the operating system rather than read out of the environment.
//!
//! **The whole of why this exists is who supplies the environment.** `mixengine-elevate` is started
//! by the daemon through the elevation prompt, and whether the process that prompt creates carries
//! the daemon's environment block is not something this workspace establishes — so a binary running
//! as root that resolves `%ProgramFiles%` is resolving a value it cannot show it chose. The design
//! rule for that binary is not *prove it is safe*, it is
//! `.claude/architecture/security-model.md`'s *"validates everything again rather than trusting its
//! caller"*; `SHGetKnownFolderPath` removes the question instead of answering it.
//!
//! Three callers. Two are about a directory root owns: the audit log's
//! ([`crate::elevated::audit_directory`]) and the one the privileged helper is installed into
//! ([`crate::install::helper_path`]). The third is [`local_app_data`], which is about the per-user
//! directory the installer wrote — asked the same way the installer asks it. See the T85 design,
//! D4, and the T107 design, D1.
