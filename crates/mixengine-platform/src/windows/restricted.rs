//! A child created from a restricted copy of this process's token — roadmap task **T34a**.
//!
//! **Why this exists, in one sentence a reader can check:** `postgres` calls `check_root()` at
//! startup, which on Windows asks `pgwin32_is_admin()`, and a process whose token holds
//! `BUILTIN\Administrators` as an *enabled* group is refused with *Execution of PostgreSQL by a
//! user with administrative permissions is not permitted*.
//!
//! An ordinary machine never meets that: an interactive administrator carries a UAC-*filtered*
//! token where the group is present deny-only and grants nothing. The machine that meets it is this
//! repository's own Windows CI leg, which holds a full token deliberately and asserts that it still
//! does (T2b, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`).
//!
//! **So every supervised child is created from a restricted token, not only PostgreSQL's.** The
//! decision and its reasons are
//! `docs/decisions/0010-supervised-child-never-inherits-administrators.md`; the shortest of them
//! is that on a normal machine this changes nothing, because disabling a group that is already
//! deny-only is a no-op.
//!
//! The two SIDs dropped are the two PostgreSQL's own `src/common/restricted_token.c` drops, for the
//! same reason and in the same order.
//!
//! # Why this is hand-rolled rather than a `Command`
//!
//! [`std::process::Command`] has no way to state a token, and `CreateProcessAsUserW` hands back a
//! raw handle that no [`std::process::Child`] can be built from. What buys the cost is a second
//! thing this gets for free: handles are inherited **explicitly**, through
//! `PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST`, rather than by setting `bInheritHandles` and hoping — which
//! is the window `hide_stdio_from_children` exists to guard on the paths that still use `Command`.
//!
//! `CreateProcessAsUserW` needs no privilege when the token is a restricted version of the caller's
//! own. That special case is why `initdb` and `pg_ctl` can already do this to themselves, and it is
//! why nothing here goes through `mixengine-elevate`.
//!
//! # A weaker token still has to reach what its child creates
//!
//! Disabling a group a token's *default* access control list is written in terms of leaves a child
//! that cannot open the objects it creates itself, and a process in that state cannot finish
//! starting. See [`keep_what_a_child_creates_reachable`], which is where the measurement that found
//! it is written down.
