//! This user's `Path`, in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`.
//!
//! Windows keeps the environment a new process inherits in the registry, in two places: a
//! machine-wide one under `HKLM` and a per-user one under `HKCU`. **Only the second is ever
//! touched.** It needs no elevation, it belongs to the account MixEngine runs as, and the machine
//! one is shared with every other user on the box — a development tool has no business in it.
//!
//! What that costs is stated rather than hidden: `explorer` builds a process's `PATH` as the machine
//! value followed by the user one, so a PHP installed for the whole machine is *ahead* of
//! `<root>/bin` no matter what this writes. Prepending inside the value we own is as far as a
//! user-level change reaches; `mix doctor` (T47) is where "something else is answering `php`"
//! belongs.
//!
//! # Why the API rather than `setx`
//!
//! `docs/architecture/platform-abstraction.md`, rule 5: use the Windows API where there is one.
//! `setx` would do the job and would also **truncate the value at 1024 characters**, which is a
//! documented limit of that tool and not of the registry — on a developer's machine a user `Path`
//! past a kilobyte is ordinary, and the failure mode is losing the second half of somebody's PATH
//! for good. `RegSetValueExW` has no such limit.
//!
//! # The two things that are preserved rather than rewritten
//!
//! **The value's type.** A user `Path` is normally `REG_EXPAND_SZ`, which is what makes
//! `%USERPROFILE%\go\bin` mean something; reading one and writing it back as `REG_SZ` would turn
//! every such entry into a directory that does not exist. So the type that was there is the type
//! that goes back, and `REG_EXPAND_SZ` is used only when there was no value at all.
//!
//! **Every entry that is not ours.** The value is split, ours is inserted or dropped, and the rest
//! is joined back verbatim — empty segments and trailing semicolons included. Tidying somebody's
//! `PATH` is not what they asked for, and a "cleanup" that drops an entry it thought was redundant
//! is the one bug nobody would ever attribute to this.
