//! Windows: the `Root` store under `LocalMachine`, through the certificate-store API.
//!
//! **Through the API rather than `certutil.exe`** — the T49a design, D6. `.claude/features/tls.md`
//! names CryptoAPI first with `certutil` as a fallback; the fallback is not built. This crate
//! already reaches Windows through `windows-sys` for the resolver's registry work and the named
//! pipe's DACL, and a process spawned from a context holding an administrative token is a larger
//! surface than four API calls.
//!
//! **Opening the store to read needs no administrative token**, which is what makes it affordable
//! for the producer to ask on every daemon start and for `mix doctor` to ask whenever somebody does.
//! `tests/trust.rs` measures that in CI's ordinary `test` job rather than this comment asserting it.
//!
//! Features on `windows-sys` add modules and not crates, so `Win32_Security_Cryptography` does not
//! move `mixengine-elevate`'s dependency budget.
