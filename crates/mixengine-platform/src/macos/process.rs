//! `setsid` from `unix/`, and an honest account of what this system does not offer.
//!
//! This module exists to say something rather than to do something. Its Linux counterpart adds
//! `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` to a supervised spawn; macOS has no equivalent, so a supervised child here is
//! exactly `setsid` and nothing more:
//!
//! - a daemon that **exits** takes its services down, because dropping the supervisor handle kills
//!   the group;
//! - a daemon that is **killed** takes nothing down. The services keep running, and neither the
//!   kernel nor the child will notice.
//!
//! That is a real gap and it is deliberately not papered over — `mix doctor` and the GUI say which
//! of the three platforms they are on rather than repeating a guarantee only Windows keeps.
//! `.claude/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` records why the alternatives
//! lost: a watchdog inside the child only works for a child we wrote, and MixEngine supervises
//! `php-fpm`, `mariadbd` and `caddy`. What covers the gap instead is crash recovery at the next boot
//! (roadmap task T18) — pid *and* start time, reconciled — which has to exist on every platform
//! anyway for the machine that lost power.

// along with it. Stopping a process this one did not start is POSIX too — the same `kill` to a
// negated pid — so both halves of it come from there as well; only *reading* when a process began
// is per-system, because this one has no `/proc`.
