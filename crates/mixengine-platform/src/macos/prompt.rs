//! Raising the administrator prompt on the one-shot helper.

//! `do shell script … with administrator privileges`, which is Apple's remaining supported way to
//! run one program elevated from a program that is not: `AuthorizationExecuteWithPrivileges` has
//! been deprecated since 10.7, and `SMJobBless` installs a **persistent** privileged helper, which
//! ADR 0005 rules out.
//!
//! **The script is a compile-time constant and the two paths arrive as `argv`** — see
//! `crate::prompt::macos::SCRIPT`, and the T40a design, D3. Interpolating a path into an AppleScript
//! string literal is the line T40/D9 singles out as the single most dangerous one in the elevation
//! path on any of the three systems, and `quoted form of` is AppleScript's own answer to it.
