//! would mean a new unsafe FFI surface inside `mixengine-elevate`, whose whole design constraint is
//! that a person can audit it by reading it, for an operation that runs once per install. The rule
//! T42 set with `pfctl` and T45 kept with `systemctl` holds here: one fixed command, a constant
//! argument vector, and no argument taken from the request.
//!
//! Reading is `security find-certificate -a -p`, which lists every certificate in a keychain as PEM
//! and **needs no administrative token** — measured by `tests/trust.rs` in CI's ordinary `test` job
//! rather than asserted here.
