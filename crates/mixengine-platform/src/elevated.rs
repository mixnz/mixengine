//! The primitives that only mean anything under an administrative token.
//!
//! **Two callers and one split**, since T85. The *writing* half — the elevation bit, the audit
//! directory, the root-owned `mkdir` — is `mixengine-elevate`'s alone and stays behind the
//! `elevated` feature, so that binary can take this crate without `tokio`, `keyring` or
//! `directories` (the T40 design, D8). The *reading* half — [`owner_of`] and [`others_can_write`] —
//! is also the daemon's, because the question it answers is *may I run this file as root?* and that
//! is asked on the unprivileged side of the boundary, before a prompt is spent. Same shape as
//! `hosts`, `port_access`, `resolver` and `trust`, one capability along.
//!
//! **The identity of a caller is the owner of the file it wrote**, and that is the whole reason
//! [`owner_of`] exists. The daemon runs as the user, and if the daemon is compromised it *is* the
//! attacker, so nothing the request document asserts about who is asking can be believed. The
//! filesystem's answer can: `PKEXEC_UID`, a walk up to a parent process and an environment variable
//! are three mechanisms that differ per OS and two of which an attacker sets.
