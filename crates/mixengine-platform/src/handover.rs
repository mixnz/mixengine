//! Becoming another program, and the record a resolver hands a trampoline — roadmap task **T185**.
//!
//! **Its own feature, because `mixengine-trampoline` takes this and nothing else.** A trampoline is
//! copied into `<root>/bin` once per command name on Windows, so every byte it links is paid for
//! dozens of times, and `process` would bring tokio with it. See
//! `docs/specs/2026-09-25-t185-a-bin-that-weighs-almost-nothing-design.md`.
//!
//! # The record
//!
//! What the resolver would have handed to [`hand_over`], written to its stdout instead: the
//! program, the arguments that go before the user's, and the environment to set. A sequence of
//! fields, each a tag byte, a native-endian `usize` length, and the value as this OS spells an
//! `OsStr` — UTF-16 code units on Windows, bytes on Unix — so nothing that is not Unicode is lost.
//! Resolver and trampoline ship in one release for one machine, so the two ends always agree on
//! endianness and width.

/// **What a shim is made of.** A process the user invoked as `php` has worked out which PHP this
/// directory means and now has to get out of the way of it — with the same arguments, the same
/// standard streams, the same terminal and, at the end, the same exit code. `env` is applied *over*
/// this process's own environment rather than replacing it, which is the opposite of
/// `process::spawn_supervised` and for the opposite reason: a service's environment is declared in full by
/// its spec, and a shim is standing in the middle of somebody's shell session, where everything they
/// exported has to arrive intact.
///
/// # Unix: there is nothing to describe
///
/// `execve`. The process image is replaced, so the pid, the streams, the terminal, the process group
/// and every signal disposition are the ones the user's shell set up — Ctrl-C reaches the program
/// because the program *is* this process. **It returns only on failure**, which is why the `i32` in
/// the signature is Windows's answer and not a value any Unix caller will see.
///
/// # Windows: a child, and two things arranged around it
///
/// There is no `exec`, so the program is a child of a process that then does nothing but wait.
///
/// - **A Job Object with `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`**, so a shim that is killed does not leave the program
///   it fronted running: `taskkill` on a `php -S` would otherwise take the shim and leave the
///   server holding the port, with nothing on the machine still naming it.
/// - **Ctrl-C and Ctrl-Break are swallowed by this process**, in `windows/handover.rs`.
///   A console event goes to *every* process attached to the console, so the child already has its
///   own copy; the default handling would end the shim first, close the job, and kill the child
///   before it could act on the interrupt it had just been sent. Closing the window, signing out and
///   shutting down are deliberately left alone — those are the cases where the child *should* go
///   down with this process.
///
/// **A child that exits before it can be put in the job is not a failure here**, which is where this
/// departs from `process::spawn_supervised`. Windows will not assign an ended process to a job and reports
/// that as `ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED`, indistinguishable from a real refusal — and for a shim the case is
/// not exotic but the common one, since `php -v` is over in a few milliseconds. Failing the run, or
/// killing the child, would turn the ordinary invocation into an error; so the assignment is
/// attempted, and the wait happens either way. What is lost when it does fail is the guarantee
/// above, for a program that has already finished.
///
/// # Errors
///
/// [`Error::Io`] naming the program when it cannot be started at all — which for a shim means an
/// install whose directory has been emptied — and [`Error::Os`] when Windows will not create the job
/// object, will not let this process handle its own console events, or cannot be waited on.
