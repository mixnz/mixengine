//! Raising the polkit prompt on the one-shot helper.
//!
//! **`--disable-internal-agent`.** Without it, a `pkexec` that finds no authentication agent falls
//! back to the textual one built into itself, which prompts on the controlling terminal — a terminal
//! a daemon does not have and could not show anybody if it did. With it, `pkexec` fails at once. The
//! environment check below is a heuristic and can be wrong; this flag is what makes being wrong
//! cheap, because the failure is then a fast non-zero exit rather than a process waiting forever on
//! a tty nobody is watching. See the T40a design, D5, and ADR 0005, which calls this the worst
//! failure mode of the three systems.
//!
//! **No polkit action file is shipped.** `pkexec` run against a program with no registered action
//! falls back to `org.freedesktop.policykit.exec`, which asks for an administrator password and
//! caches the credential briefly — the same shape as the other two systems. Installing a `.policy`
//! file into `/usr/share/polkit-1/actions/` is itself a privileged operation, which would mean
//! needing elevation in order to be able to elevate.
