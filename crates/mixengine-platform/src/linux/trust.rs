//! Linux: an anchor file, and a command that folds it into the bundle everything else reads.
//!
//! **Two families, and neither is the platform** — the T49a design, D7. Debian keeps machine-added
//! anchors in `/usr/local/share/ca-certificates` and refreshes with `update-ca-certificates`; Red
//! Hat keeps them in `/etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors` and refreshes with `update-ca-trust`. A
//! machine with neither directory has no system store MixEngine knows how to write, which is
//! [`TrustStoreMethod::None`] and a supported mode rather than a failure — browsers here read NSS
//! anyway, which is T49b's.
//!
//! **Detected by probing for the directories, never by parsing `/etc/os-release`.**
//! `.claude/features/tls.md` asks for that in a sentence of its own, and a version string is a thing
//! distributions change.
//!
//! **Being in the anchors directory is not the same as being trusted**, which is why the probe
//! checks two things. A file that was written and never folded in — the refresh command failed, or
//! an image was built with one and not the other — is a certificate `curl` does not accept, and
//! reporting it as installed would report a home as working when its HTTPS does not.
