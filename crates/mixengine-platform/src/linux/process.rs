//! `setsid` from `unix/`, plus the one thing only Linux can do about a parent that dies.
//!
//! Everything a detached child needs is POSIX and is next door. What is here is the *supervised*
//! side, and it is here rather than in `unix/` because `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` is a Linux invention that
//! macOS has no equivalent of — the case the "anything the two do differently stays in their own
//! directory" rule exists for.
//!
//! **It is a guard, not a guarantee**, and the difference is written down in
//! `.claude/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` rather than quietly averaged
//! into the Windows promise. `PR_SET_PDEATHSIG` reaches the process we started and nothing it
//! starts, so a php-fpm master dies and its pool workers are reparented to init; it is keyed to the
//! parent *thread*, so in a daemon with a thread pool it arrives when whichever worker did the spawn
//! exits rather than when the daemon does; and it is cleared across a setuid `exec`. What covers the
//! rest is crash recovery at the next boot (roadmap task T18), which has to exist anyway for the
//! machine that lost power.

/// `btime` is recomputed from the monotonic-to-real offset and *moves* when the clock is stepped, so
/// building a wall-clock moment out of it would refuse to adopt a perfectly healthy service after an
/// NTP correction — trading a rare wrong identification for a rare killed database. The residual is
/// therefore accepted and written down, exactly as
/// `.claude/decisions/0007-supervised-child-owns-a-process-group.md` accepts its pid-recycling race:
