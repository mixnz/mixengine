//! The local endpoint the daemon listens on and every client dials.
//!
//! One shape, two implementations, exactly as `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md` describes
//! them: a Unix domain socket in `run/` on Linux and macOS, a named pipe on Windows. Neither is a
//! network socket — the daemon opens no TCP port by default, so there is nothing for another
//! machine to reach and nothing for a firewall to have an opinion about.
//!
//! **Two gates, not one.** The endpoint's own permissions come first — mode `0600` on the socket,
//! a DACL naming this account and nobody else on the pipe — because they are enforced by the
//! kernel before any of our code runs. The peer check on top of them is what notices when the
//! first gate was not applied the way we think it was: a socket restored with somebody else's
//! mode, a pipe created by a build of MixEngine whose DACL was wrong. It answers "who is this",
//! never "what may they do" — every client of this daemon is the user, and the user may do
//! everything.
//!
//! **Both gates face one way, so the client has one of its own.** They protect the daemon from a
//! stranger who dials it, and say nothing about a client that dialled a stranger. That asymmetry is
//! only theoretical on Unix — the socket is a file inside a `run/` this account owns, and no other
//! account can put one there to be found instead — and is real on Windows, where the pipe namespace
//! is flat and machine-wide and the name is derivable. So [`Connection::connect`] asks who is
//! serving the endpoint before it writes anything, and returns
//! [`Error::EndpointNotOurs`](crate::Error::EndpointNotOurs) when the answer is somebody else.
//!
//! This module deliberately does not speak HTTP or JSON-RPC. It hands back a byte stream
//! ([`Connection`] is `AsyncRead + AsyncWrite`); the protocol on top of it is the daemon's business
//! (roadmap task T8).
