//! The lock that makes one daemon per home.
//!
//! `run/mixengined.lock` is held for as long as the daemon runs and released by the operating
//! system when it stops — including when it is killed, which is the whole reason the lock is a file
//! handle and not a pid file somebody has to clean up. A stale lock file is therefore not a state
//! this code has to recognise: the file surviving means nothing, only the handle does.
//!
//! **This is not the same question the endpoint answers.** [`ipc::Listener::bind`](crate::ipc)
//! already refuses to start a second daemon that arrives *after* the first, and does it by dialling
//! the endpoint. What is left for the lock is two daemons starting at the same instant, where both
//! can find the endpoint dead and, on Unix, the second one's `bind` replaces the first one's socket
//! file while the first is still listening on it. The lock is taken before anything else so that
//! outcome is unreachable rather than merely tidied up afterwards, and it is why the daemon takes it
//! **before** it opens SQLite: `sqlx-sqlite` implements the migration lock as a no-op, so two
//! daemons that get that far can both read the schema as behind and both migrate it.
//!
//! **A daemon that finds the lock taken is not a failure**, which is why [`Acquired`] is not a
//! `Result`: the caller asked for a running daemon and there is one. `docs/architecture/daemon-and-ipc.md`
//! has it exit successfully after printing the endpoint, and that is only a sensible thing to do if
//! the answer arrives as an outcome rather than as an error somebody has to classify.
//!
//! Not a [`Host`](crate::Host) capability, for the same reason [`ipc`](crate::ipc) is not: what is
//! being tested is whether *this* operating system keeps a second process out, and a mock that
//! answered from memory would prove nothing about that.
