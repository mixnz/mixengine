/// Every OS capability MixEngine needs, in one injectable object.
///
/// The daemon is constructed with an `Arc<dyn Host>` rather than calling free functions, which is
/// what makes the whole system testable: `mock::Host` answers the same questions from memory and
/// records the mutations it was asked for.
///
/// Capabilities arrive one accessor at a time as the roadmap reaches them.
///
/// **The firewall is here to be read and never to be written.** Opening a port needs a token the
/// daemon does not have, so writing stays a
/// [`FirewallApply`](mixengine_proto::privileged::PrivilegedOp::FirewallApply) enqueued the way the
/// resolver's changes are and executed by `mixengine-elevate` out of [`crate::firewall`]; no
/// accessor below leads to it.
///
/// Reading arrived with T76, and the reason is that the interesting rule is not one of ours. Binding
/// UDP 5353 for mDNS makes Windows offer to write an every-port rule for `mixengined.exe`, and a
/// daemon cannot learn about a rule it never made from its own database. Reading needs no privilege
