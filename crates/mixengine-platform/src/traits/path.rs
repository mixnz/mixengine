//! Putting `<root>/bin` on the PATH that every shell this user starts inherits.
//!
//! **One entry, never one per version.** What goes on the PATH is the directory of shims
//! ([runtime-versions.md](../../../../docs/features/runtime-versions.md)), and the shim is what
//! decides which PHP a directory uses — so the PATH is written once, at the moment somebody asks
//! for it, and never touched again when a version is installed or removed.
//!
//! **Nothing here is elevated, on any of the three systems.** The user's own environment is a
//! user-writable registry value on Windows and a file in the user's home on both others, so this
//! capability does what `docs/architecture/overview.md` says every other change outside the root
//! needs `mixengine-elevate` for — and needs it for none of it. Which is also why it stays out of
//! the privileged-operation list: an operation that would prompt for a password to edit
//! `~/.zprofile` would be teaching people to type one for no reason.
//!
//! **The one thing a user-level change cannot promise is precedence.** On Windows the effective
//! PATH is the machine's value followed by this user's, so a PHP installed for the whole machine is
//! ahead of `<root>/bin` whatever this writes; on Unix a profile file is read before whatever a
//! later-sourced script does to `PATH`. Prepending inside the value we own is the most either
//! system allows without touching something that is not ours, and `mix doctor` (T47) is where
//! "something else is winning" belongs.
