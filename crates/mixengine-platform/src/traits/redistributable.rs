//! Running Microsoft's Visual C++ Redistributable installer, once somebody agreed to it — roadmap
//! task **T150**.
//!
//! **The one place MixEngine starts a program that asks Windows for administrator rights and is not
//! `mixengine-elevate`** — ADR 0037. What makes that acceptable is here: the file is believed only
//! after Windows accepts its signature, its signer is Microsoft, and it names itself the
//! redistributable; and it is held against change until it has run.
//!
//! **The half that is a decision is compiled everywhere**, on [`crate::AppControl`]'s pattern.
