/// anywhere in it, and a mock that had to fabricate a whole `PrivilegedResponse` would be a mock of
/// something that is not the OS. T40b reads it. See the T40a design, D1.

/// **Nothing here takes a command or an argument list.** Both paths are the caller's, every
/// invocation is composed from them and from constants belonging to the implementation, and there is

    /// is there, which is nearly a constant. Linux is the system where the question has a real
    /// answer, and where it decides whether anything is spawned at all.
