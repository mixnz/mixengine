//! Registering the daemon so this machine starts it again at the next login.
//!
//! **"Service" here is the operating system's word, not MixEngine's.** The trait is
//! [`ServiceInstaller`] because
//! [ADR 0002](../../../../docs/decisions/0002-cross-platform-from-day-one.md) named it that on
//! the first day and an accepted decision record is not edited; what it installs is one autostart
//! entry for `mixengined`, and nothing in it is about MariaDB or php-fpm. Everything a reader meets
//! more often — this module, the values below, the API, the command — is spelled `autostart`.
//!
//! **Nothing here is elevated, on any of the three systems.** A Task Scheduler logon task under this
//! account's own SID, a plist in this user's `~/Library/LaunchAgents`, a systemd *user* unit in this
//! user's `~/.config` — all three belong to the account MixEngine runs as, so this capability does
//! what `docs/architecture/overview.md` says every other change outside the root needs
//! `mixengine-elevate` for, and needs it for none of it. Which is also why it stays out of the
//! privileged-operation list, exactly as [`PathIntegration`](crate::PathIntegration) does.
//!
//! **One entry per user, and it names one home.** The mechanisms are per-user and MixEngine is
//! per-home; a label keyed by the home would produce entries nobody could find by looking, and ones
//! nothing could enumerate at uninstall. So enabling from a second home replaces the entry, and
//! [`AutostartState::command`] is what lets an answer say *"registered — for another home"* rather
//! than *"registered"*.
//!
//! **`enable` registers and does not start; `disable` removes and does not stop.** Somebody who
//! asked for "start at login" did not ask for "start it", and somebody who turned that off must not
//! lose the daemon they are using.
