//! The [`PathIntegration`] contract, against the host that answers from memory.
//!
//! `docs/architecture/platform-abstraction.md` splits this deliberately: trait-level behaviour is
//! proved against `mock`, and each real implementation proves *its own* mechanism in its own module
//! — the registry round trip inside `windows/path.rs`, the marked block inside `unix/path.rs`, each
//! against a key or a home directory the test creates and deletes. What is left for this file is the
//! part every implementation has to agree on, and the part a caller writes code against: that adding
//! twice writes once, that a read is not a mutation, and that a machine which cannot do this at all
//! says so rather than reporting a PATH it did not change.
