//! Who is listening on a local TCP port, against the real OS.
//!
//! Not `#[ignore]`d and not a system test: every port here is an ephemeral one the OS handed this
//! process for the length of one test. `docs/standards/testing.md` rules out 53, 80 and 443,
//! which is a different question from binding whatever is free.
//!
//! **The subject is this process.** A test that went looking for somebody else's server would be
//! asserting about whatever the machine running it happens to have installed; a test that binds a
//! port itself knows the pid and the program name the answer has to carry, on every OS.
