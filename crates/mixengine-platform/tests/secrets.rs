//! The credential store, against the real OS.
//!
//! **Not `#[ignore]`d, and the reason is the same one `access.rs` gives.** These touch the real
//! Credential Manager, Keychain or secret service, but only under a service name this test invents
//! for itself and deletes on the way out — the credential-store equivalent of a `TempDir`, not a
//! system file with other people's entries in it. Nothing here reads or removes anything MixEngine
//! or anybody else wrote.
//!
//! **A machine with no store is a passing run, not a failure.** A headless Linux — a CI container,
//! an SSH session with no desktop — has no secret service, and the answer this capability owes there
//! is [`Error::UnsupportedPlatform`], which these tests assert instead of skipping silently. That
//! way the two outcomes are "the store works" and "the OS said, in the typed way, that it has none",
//! and a *third* one — a store that quietly forgets — cannot pass.
//!
//! **One test at a time against the real store, and the reason is Windows.** Cargo runs the tests
//! in this binary on parallel threads, and the Credential Manager sometimes answers a read on one
//! thread with *not found* for a credential another thread has just finished writing — CI's Windows
//! runner read `None` back from a value it had stored three times in one week (2026-09-04, twice,
//! and 2026-09-07), in two different tests here, and never on the other two systems. `keyring`'s
//! maintainers measured the same thing and could not fix it in the library
//! (<https://github.com/open-source-cooperative/keyring-rs/issues/163>): it never happens under
//! `--test-threads=1`, so the store is treated as something these tests take turns at, through
//! [`STORE`], rather than something the runner is told to serialise from the command line — a flag
//! on one job is a fix nobody running `cargo test` at home gets.
