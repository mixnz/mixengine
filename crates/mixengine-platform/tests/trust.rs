//! Reading this machine's trust store, which every daemon start does.
//!
//! **What is proved here is that the read succeeds, not what it returns.** A clean runner holds no
//! MixEngine authority, so `installed: false` is the expected answer; the claim under test is that
//! an *ordinary account* can ask at all.
//!
//! **These are deliberately not `#[ignore]`d.** `docs/standards/testing.md` rule 1 names the trust
//! store, and the gate it asks for is for tests that **touch** one — these only read. Being in CI's
//! ordinary `test` job, on all three runners and under no administrative token, is the entire point:
//! the T49a design's D13 records that neither of the two assumptions below could be measured on the
//! machine that design was written on, and names this file as where they are measured instead.
//!
//! If either fails, the producer in `mixengine-daemon` and `mix doctor`'s check both need a
//! different shape, because both are built on reading a store being cheap and unprivileged.
