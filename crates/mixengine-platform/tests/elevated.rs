//! The primitives the elevated helper is built out of, against the real OS.

//! Nothing here is a system test: no privileged directory is created, and every assertion reads a
//! fact rather than attempting an access a token gets to decide. That distinction is the Privilege
//! section of `docs/standards/testing.md` — the Windows leg of CI runs under a full administrator
//! token, so a test that proved something by *trying* it would pass there for a reason that will not
//! exist on a user's machine.
