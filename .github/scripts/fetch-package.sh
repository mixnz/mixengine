#       <kind> <version> <VARIABLE> [directory]
#
# **Every fetch in CI goes through here since T172a.** `bench` was its first caller; the eleven
# "Fetch a real X" steps of `services` and `system` were each about forty lines of bash inside YAML,
# the same forty lines with a version, a variable and a smoke check changed, and they are now one
# line each. What only one package needs stays beside its step: nginx is packed as a whole tree
# because the generated configuration reads its `conf/` by absolute path, and that is the
# fixture's business rather than this script's.
#
# `--absent-on <RUNNER_OS-RUNNER_ARCH>` names a runner nothing is published for — Windows on ARM,
# for most servers. There this says so and succeeds without setting the variable, and every suite
# that reads it already skips when it is unset: exactly what the inline steps did.
#
# `--probe "<path> <args>"` runs the unpacked program once, relative to the directory and with
# `.exe` appended on Windows, so a broken archive fails in the fetch step rather than inside a
# suite. The first probe whose program exists is the one run: PHP names two, because its publisher
# puts `bin/php` on Unix and `php.exe` at the root on Windows.
#
# It writes `<VARIABLE>=<directory>` into `$GITHUB_ENV`, which is what the suites read, and prints
# the directory. A missing archive is a failure rather than a skipped measurement: a bench that
# quietly measured two services would report a number nobody could compare.
