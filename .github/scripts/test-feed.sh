# T88's D13: exercise `packaging/feed.sh` on every CI run, against a fixture distribution directory.
#
# The script it tests writes the one document an installed MixEngine reads to find out that a newer
# one exists, and the only other thing that would ever run it is a release. So it is run here
# instead, and the properties that matter are asserted: the hash and the size describe the file
# beside them, `provides` is read out of the archive rather than assumed, and a universal macOS file
# produces two rows — one per architecture — pointing at the same URL.
#
# **Since T182b, D5 the one payload is the Windows zip**; macOS and Linux are updated by their
# installers, which the feed lists under `installers`, two flavours each.
