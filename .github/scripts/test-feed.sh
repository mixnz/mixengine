# one exists, and the only other thing that would ever run it is a release. So it is run here
# instead, and the properties that matter are asserted: the hash and the size describe the file
# beside them, `provides` is read out of the archive rather than assumed, and a universal macOS
# archive produces two rows — one per architecture — pointing at the same URL.
