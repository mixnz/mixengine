# .claude/standards/testing.md forbids network access in tests outside of MockRegistry, which serves
# its index and artifacts over loopback. This script enforces that rule by putting the suite in a
# private network namespace containing nothing but `lo`: an accidental outbound connection fails in
# CI instead of turning into a flaky test that only breaks when GitHub is slow.
#
# Two mechanisms are tried, in order of least privilege. Each is probed by running the exact thing it
# will have to do — creating the namespace *and* bringing loopback up — because a namespace without
# working loopback would break MockRegistry rather than block the network. If neither mechanism is
# available the suite still runs, since a missing sandbox is an environment problem and not a test
# failure, but the job log says so loudly.
#
# **A package this leg was supposed to fetch and did not is a failure**, unlike that sandbox. Every
# real-server suite below is `#[ignore]`d, so one that does not run is reported by nobody — see
# `missing` for the rest of the argument, and for the variable that opts out of it by hand.
