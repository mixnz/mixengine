# The credential-store tests against a Linux with no secret service — the machine T15b exists for,
# and the one no runner is by accident.
#
# **This is the only leg that walks the absent branch.** Everywhere else the store is there: the
# `test` job installs `gnome-keyring` on purpose so that Linux gets the coverage Windows and macOS
# get for free, which leaves the answer a machine *without* one gets as a path every green run
# steps past. That is how T15b's bug lived long enough to be found by a stack trace.
#
# `MIXENGINE_TEST_NO_KEYRING=1` is what makes each round an assertion rather than a skip: with it
# set, `crates/mixengine-platform/tests/secrets.rs` fails if it finds a store, so a round whose
# sabotage did not work reports that instead of passing quietly.
#
# The three shapes below are the three D-Bus error names `linux/secrets.rs` matches, and they are
# genuinely different machines rather than three spellings of one — see that module.
